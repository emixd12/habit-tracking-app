# AGENTS.md

## Project

This repository contains Cadence, a public, open-source personal behavior
tracker product. The implemented surfaces are an authenticated web app for one
account at a time and a separate public Astro marketing site under
`apps/marketing`.

The app lets a user create recurring behaviors, view scheduled occurrences in a timeline, and manually mark each occurrence as Completed or Not Completed. Unmarked occurrences remain Unresolved, and prior-day unresolved occurrences are grouped under Needs decision.

Cadence may support many independent accounts, but each account remains
single-player. This is not a general productivity app, not a social habit
tracker, not a medical dosing app, not a collaboration product, and not an
admin-heavy SaaS product.

Cadence also serves as a practical reference implementation and promotion
surface for the BehaviorLog Bundle standard:
`https://github.com/emixd12/BehaviorLog-Bundle`.

## Primary stack

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Supabase Postgres
- Supabase Auth with Google login
- Supabase Row Level Security
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-style components where useful
- Sequenzy for email reminders
- Web Push for browser notifications
- Vitest for resolver tests

Public-product surfaces are scoped in `docs/PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
The Astro marketing site is implemented as a sibling app; future Tauri desktop,
mobile, shared-package, and workspace-restructuring work still requires scoped
tickets.

## Agent operating model

Before implementing a task, read in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `STATUS.md`
3. `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
4. Provider or governance docs relevant to the task:
   - `docs/SUPABASE_WORKFLOW.md`
   - `docs/SEQUENZY_WORKFLOW.md`
   - `docs/DATETIME_STRATEGY.md`
   - `docs/ROUTE_MAP.md`
   - `docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md`
   - `docs/VERCEL_WORKFLOW.md`
   - `docs/CRAWL_POLICY.md`
5. Product source-of-truth docs relevant to the task.
6. Existing tests and implementation.

`STATUS.md` is a current-state ledger. Update it when a ticket starts, completes, becomes blocked, is reopened, or materially changes scope. Do not use it to expand product scope.

If a user prompt conflicts with the docs, report the conflict before editing. If the user intentionally changes product direction, update the relevant docs in the same task.

## Source-of-truth documents

Product and implementation docs:

1. `/docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`
2. `/docs/DATA_MODEL.md`
3. `/docs/RECURRENCE_RULES.md`
4. `/docs/UI_SPEC.md`
5. `/docs/USER_FLOWS.md`
6. `/docs/INTERACTION_REGISTRY.md` plus `/interaction-registry.json`
7. `/docs/NOTIFICATION_SPEC.md`
8. `/docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md`
9. `/docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md`

- JSONL/CSV/full JSON/BehaviorLog export
- Public Astro marketing site
- Workspace split only when explicitly ticketed

Out of scope for v1:
- Multi-user collaboration
- Social features

- Native mobile apps
- Apple Health / Google Fit integration
- Structured measurement templates
- Medication dose tracking
- Supply/refill inventory
- AI coaching inside the app
- Calendar sync

- Admin dashboards
- PWA offline cache
- Offline writes or sync conflict handling
- Automatic missed status
- AI coaching or speech features
- Desktop/mobile implementation unless the proposal is explicitly scheduled

## Domain language

Use these terms consistently:

- Behavior: a recurring thing the user wants to track.
- Occurrence: one scheduled instance of a behavior.
- Unresolved: an occurrence that has not been manually marked.
- Completed: stored status meaning the behavior was completed.
- Not completed: stored status meaning the user explicitly says it was not completed. Stored as `not_completed` and displayed as Not Completed in the UI.
- Needs decision: UI group and derived state for unresolved occurrences before today. It is not a stored status.

Do not use “missed” as a stored status in v1.

## Architecture rule: resolver-first

Core logic must live in `/lib/resolvers`.

Resolvers should be pure or nearly pure functions. They should not:
- Render UI
- Query Supabase directly
- Send email
- Send push notifications
- Read browser APIs
- Read environment variables
- Mutate global state

Repositories in `/lib/db` own database access.

Services in `/lib/services` orchestrate repositories and resolvers.

UI components call services/server actions. UI components must not implement recurrence, reminder, analytics, or export logic.

API routes and cron/process routes must call services. They must not duplicate resolver logic.

Run `npm run resolvers:check` after resolver, service, API route, cron/process, or UI logic changes.

## Required resolver modules

Implement and preserve these modules:

- `/lib/resolvers/recurrence.resolver.ts`
- `/lib/resolvers/occurrence.resolver.ts`
- `/lib/resolvers/timeline.resolver.ts`
- `/lib/resolvers/status.resolver.ts`
- `/lib/resolvers/reminder.resolver.ts`
- `/lib/resolvers/analytics.resolver.ts`
- `/lib/resolvers/export.resolver.ts`

The registry, allowed callers, forbidden bypasses, and paired tests live in `/docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md`.

## Status rules

Stored statuses:

```ts
type OccurrenceStatus = "unresolved" | "completed" | "not_completed";
```

Rules:
- New occurrences start as unresolved.
- The system must not automatically mark unresolved items as missed.
- At midnight, unresolved items from prior days move into the Needs decision UI group.
- The user can change a resolved status later.
- Notes can be added or edited.
- Needs decision is derived from `status === "unresolved"` and `local_date` before the current local date.
- Unresolved is shown separately and excluded from final adherence calculations.

## Date and time rules

Use the user's timezone, defaulting to America/New_York.

The day boundary is local midnight.

Date/time implementation details are locked in `docs/DATETIME_STRATEGY.md`:

- Use Temporal for timezone-aware recurrence and day-boundary logic when implementation begins.
- Store both UTC instants (`timestamptz`) and local calendar dates (`local_date`).
- Inject `now` into resolvers. Do not call `new Date()` inside resolvers.
- Do not parse `YYYY-MM-DD` with JavaScript `Date`.

## Recurrence rules

Supported v1 recurrence types:

- Daily
- Every N days
- Weekly on selected weekdays
- Every N weeks on selected weekdays
- Monthly on day N

Monthly day rule:
- If a behavior is scheduled for day 31 and a month has no day 31, schedule it on the last day of that month.

Do not implement natural-language recurrence in v1.

Do not expose raw cron syntax in the user interface.

## Reminder rules

Browser reminders:
- Enabled by default for every behavior.
- Only work after the user grants browser notification permission and registers a push subscription.
- If push is unavailable or denied, the app still works.

Email reminders:
- Disabled by default.
- Can be enabled per behavior.
- Can use a reminder offset, such as 1 day before or 3 days before.
- Use Sequenzy as the provider.
- Use the Sequenzy CLI workflow in `docs/SEQUENZY_WORKFLOW.md` for provider setup, template inspection, and test sends.

Reminder delivery rules:
- Reminders should be stored in `reminder_deliveries`.
- Pending reminders should be cancelled when an occurrence is resolved before the reminder sends.
- Failed reminders should be logged.
- Reminder processing should be idempotent.
- Reminder processing must avoid duplicate sends.

## Supabase CLI rules

Supabase is CLI-first in this repo. Use `docs/SUPABASE_WORKFLOW.md` rather than rediscovering provider steps.

Project-local command form:

```bash
npm run supabase -- <command>
```

Rules:
- Use Supabase migrations for schema changes.
- Never change the hosted database directly.
- Keep local and hosted schema congruent through git-tracked migrations.
- Run `npm run supabase -- db reset` to verify migrations from a clean local database.
- Use `npm run supabase -- db push` for hosted deployment only after user authorization.
- Generate database types after schema changes.

Never change the database schema without:
- A migration file
- Updated `/docs/DATA_MODEL.md`
- Updated TypeScript types if needed
- Tests or manual QA notes

All user-owned tables must include `user_id`.

Exception: `profiles` uses `id` as the authenticated user's id (`auth.users.id`) instead of a separate `user_id`; its RLS ownership rule is `id = auth.uid()`.

All user-owned tables must have RLS policies.

Even though each account is single-player, do not bypass RLS in normal app
code.

## Sequenzy CLI rules

Sequenzy is CLI-first for provider operations in this repo. Use `docs/SEQUENZY_WORKFLOW.md`.

Project-local command form:

```bash
npm run sequenzy -- <command>
```

Rules:
- Use `npm run sequenzy -- whoami` before provider operations that require auth.
- Use `npm run sequenzy -- login` when the user authorizes login.
- Do not send real emails without an explicit user-approved test recipient or production send instruction.
- Keep `SEQUENZY_API_KEY` server-only.
- Do not expose Sequenzy secrets to the browser.
- Keep provider calls in services/adapters, not resolvers.

## Route rules

The Timeline screen is the main screen.

Primary screens:
- Timeline: `/timeline`
- Behaviors: `/behaviors`
- Export: `/export`
- Settings: `/settings`

Behavior analytics and selected-day review live on `/behaviors`.
`/analytics` is a protected compatibility redirect to `/behaviors`, not a
primary screen.

Do not create `/dashboard` in v1.

Route ownership and planned API routes live in `docs/ROUTE_MAP.md`.

## Offline and PWA rules

Offline behavior and PWA caching are deferred from v1.

Do not implement offline mutation in v1.

Future offline/PWA work is tracked in `/docs/FUTURE_UPDATES.md`.

## Testing rules

Every resolver must have tests.

Minimum tests:
- Recurrence generation
- Monthly day 31 fallback
- Weekly and every-other-week scheduling
- Midnight day boundary
- Timeline grouping for prior unresolved items
- Status transitions
- Reminder delivery generation
- Export formatting

Before considering a ticket complete, run:

```bash
npm run agents:check
npm run interactions:check
npm run resolvers:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

If a command does not exist yet, either add it or state clearly that it is not available.

## UI and design rules

The interface should be sparse.

When changing reusable UI, design tokens, component inventories, templates, navigation, layout shells, or design-system pages, invoke the design-system-bench skill.

Occurrence rows should expose:
- Completed
- Not Completed
- Note

Avoid:
- Dense dashboards
- Gamified streaks
- Social language
- Productivity-app sprawl
- Excessive modals
- Complex settings

For UI/design work, use the project-local impeccable workflow before editing UI:

```bash
node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/context.mjs
```

Then read `.agents/skills/impeccable/reference/product.md`. If a specific impeccable command is relevant, read the matching reference file.

`DESIGN.md` is seeded. After real UI exists beyond the scaffold, update it from actual code rather than intentions.

`interaction-registry.json` is the canonical inventory of implemented user
interaction intents. Update it in the same change whenever a user-facing
interaction is added, removed, renamed, moved, gated differently, or given a
materially different side effect. Run `npm run interactions:check`; the command
is also enforced by `npm run agents:check`.

## Completion criteria for any coding task

A task is complete only when:

1. The implementation matches the relevant docs.
2. Resolver logic is tested when resolver logic exists or changes.
3. Agent drift checks pass.
4. TypeScript passes.
5. Lint passes.
6. Tests pass.
7. Build passes.
8. Schema changes include migrations.
9. UI changes are mobile-responsive.
10. No out-of-scope features were added.
11. `STATUS.md` is updated if ticket state changed.
12. The final response explains:
   - What changed
   - Files changed
   - Tests run
   - Any remaining risks or TODOs

## How to handle ambiguity

If ambiguity blocks implementation, ask a narrow question.

If ambiguity does not block implementation, make the simplest assumption consistent with the docs and document it in the final response.

Do not expand scope to solve speculative future requirements.

## Security rules

- Use Supabase Auth.
- Use Google login.
- Restrict app data to the authenticated user.
- Use RLS on all user-owned tables.
- Never commit `.env` files or secrets.
- Never expose service-role keys to the browser.
- Use server-side code for privileged operations.
- Treat provider CLI login output, API keys, and approval codes as secrets.

## Style rules

- Prefer simple TypeScript.
- Prefer explicit types.
- Prefer small functions.
- Prefer boring UI.
- Do not introduce unnecessary state-management libraries.
- Do not add a component library unless requested.
- Do not add analytics/tracking scripts unrelated to this app's internal behavior tracking.

## Implementation strategy

Implement in small vertical slices.

Do not attempt to build the whole application in one pass.

Recommended sequence:
1. Project scaffold
2. Supabase auth and schema
3. Behavior CRUD
4. Recurrence resolver
5. Occurrence generation
6. Timeline
7. Status marking
8. Notes
9. Reminder scheduling
10. Browser push
11. Email reminders
12. Analytics
13. Exports
