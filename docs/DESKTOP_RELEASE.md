# Desktop release

Ticket 113 completed the unnotarized Apple Silicon preview and updater-
acceptance milestone on 2026-08-31. The preview uses ad hoc Apple code signing
and a persistent Tauri updater signing key. It does not claim Developer ID
signing, notarization, or macOS 14 compatibility. Apple-trusted distribution
requirements moved to deferred Ticket 115.

## Completed preview milestone

Preserve Cadence, `app.cadence.desktop`, and the existing local profile/database.
Build two explicit prerelease versions, initially `0.1.1-preview.1` and
`0.1.1-preview.2`. Keep generated public configuration, artifacts, hashes, and
verification reports in ignored `.release/preview/<version>/` directories.
Never include private keys, passwords, repository credentials, or user data.
No new backend, CI, helper, cloud login, or sync is part of this milestone.

Candidate-building prerequisites are separate from final acceptance. Preview
and production candidate builds must retain structural interaction checks,
identity/version validation, safe HTTPS configuration, hardened runtime, archive
validation, and real updater signature verification. The production `check`
command retains `check-interactions.mjs --desktop-release` and all Apple checks.
An interaction stays planned until its actual acceptance evidence exists.

The preview commands are `preview-check <version>`, `preview-build <version>`,
and `preview-verify <version> <bundle-directory>` in `release.mjs`. Preview
verification requires a sealed ad hoc app, arm64, declared/compiled macOS 14
minimum, DMG integrity and matching contents, and a correctly signed updater
archive matching the verified app. Its report must state that Apple trust,
notarization, downloaded launch, live updater behavior, and untested macOS
versions are not established by local artifact checks.

The completed milestone uses the existing `emixd12/habit-tracking-app`
repository and dedicated prerelease tag `desktop-preview`, with a static feed:
`https://github.com/emixd12/habit-tracking-app/releases/download/desktop-preview/latest.json`.
Versioned asset names keep both candidates distinct. The prerelease does not use
GitHub's latest-release endpoint. The owner approved its exact release notes,
feed JSON, asset checksums, and upload plan. No repository credential belongs
in the feed or app.

Ticket 113 generated one persistent updater key after confirming no suitable
existing key. Its encrypted private key remains outside the repository with
owner-only access, and its password remains in a protected local channel. Never
print private key material or passwords. Reuse this key for future updates;
updater signing does not replace Developer ID signing or notarization.

The protected database backup preceded installation and update testing.
Downloaded DMG launch, real HTTPS update, tamper/signature rejection,
unavailable-download recovery, separate restart, and data preservation passed.
Apple's per-app approval handled the unnotarized download; no global Gatekeeper
change or quarantine removal ran. macOS 14 remains unverified.

The owner's 2026-08-31 statement authorizes the six exact assets in the
[asset checklist](qa/2026-08-30-desktop-asset-provenance.md) inside Cadence.
Existing MIT exclusions, reserved marks, and third-party notices remain intact.
The milestone does not authorize unrelated relicensing or future publication.

The two local candidates pass artifact verification. The dedicated
[desktop-preview prerelease](https://github.com/emixd12/habit-tracking-app/releases/tag/desktop-preview)
is public with eleven approved assets. A quarantined Safari download passed
macOS per-app approval. The real HTTPS `.1` to `.2` update passed signature,
tamper, unavailable-download, restart, and data-preservation acceptance on
macOS 26.5.2. See the [preview QA record](qa/2026-08-31-desktop-preview.md).
The approval packet is `apps/desktop/.release/preview/hosting/APPROVAL.md`, with
an explicit eleven-asset allowlist and five feed stages for real updater tests.
The packet discloses uncommitted build inputs and
the mismatch with the proposed baseline tag's automatic source archive.

## Persistent updater key handoff

One persistent pair was generated on 2026-08-31 after checking the usual
`~/.tauri` directory, the release-key directory, and supplied environment.
Both files belong to the owner, have mode `0600`, and live outside the repository
in a mode `0700` directory:

- Private: `/Users/emi/Library/Application Support/Cadence Release/updater/cadence-updater.key`
- Public: `/Users/emi/Library/Application Support/Cadence Release/updater/cadence-updater.key.pub`
- SHA-256 of the decoded 32-byte public key:
  `71a12820ee0af1e2795f5f0db259d38276d49307597cf889d552ccd671ab9583`

The private file is encrypted with a generated password. The password is retained
in the macOS login Keychain, service **Cadence persistent updater signing key**,
account **emi**. Generation used hidden terminal prompts; no password argument,
plaintext handoff file, or secret log was created. Actual signing with the retained
password and independent Minisign verification passed. An empty password failed.

For backup, create a secure item in your password manager named **Cadence updater
signing key**. Attach both files using the file picker; use Go to Folder to enter
the directory above. Open Keychain Access, select the login keychain, search for
the service above, and open its item. Select **Show password**, authenticate, and
copy the password directly into the password manager's protected password field.
Do not paste it into a terminal, chat, issue, or document. Clear the clipboard
afterward. Record the fingerprint in the secure item's notes. Verify both
attachments and the password before removing any backup. Password-manager backup
is an owner action and is not yet verified. Keep the working key and Keychain item
for future releases; do not regenerate per version. Losing either prevents signing
updates for installed copies using this key. See [Tauri updater signing](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/).

Downloaded previews may trigger macOS warnings because Apple has not notarized
them. After attempting to open the app, use System Settings → Privacy & Security
→ **Open Anyway** only for the verified Cadence download. Follow the per-app
confirmation and authenticate if macOS requests it. A warning that the app will
damage the computer is not an ordinary unidentified-developer warning; stop and
inspect it. Never disable Gatekeeper globally or remove quarantine to count a
test as passed. See [Apple's per-app approval instructions](https://support.apple.com/102445).

## Identity and data

The final product name is **Cadence** and its identifier is
**app.cadence.desktop**. The local QA build now uses this final identity. The earlier
`app.cadence.desktop-spike` build was shut down after verified reminder cleanup.
`apps/desktop/scripts/release-config.mjs` also enforces the final identity in a
generated release overlay. It never edits the active `tauri.conf.json`.

The native identity-adoption migration preserves the spike database, stable
profile, history, outbox, and cursors. It backs up SQLite before adoption and
does not overwrite an existing product database. Actual local identity adoption passed on 2026-08-30, preserving the profile and
history while retaining the original database. This does not replace a signed
installed-app upgrade test. Record that test before release.
Cancel the spike app's pending notifications before its final shutdown during
identity transition. macOS scopes notification requests to the app identifier;
the new identifier cannot cancel requests owned by the spike identifier.

## Update behavior

Settings reads local build configuration without contacting a server. The user
must select **Check for updates**, then **Download and install**, then
**Restart Cadence**. Leaving Settings does not cancel an approved installation.
There is no automatic launch check or downgrade override. Release notes render
as plain text. An installation error never produces an installed state.

The updater is disabled when the final identity, public key, or HTTPS feed is
absent. The native plugin rejects invalid signatures before installation.
macOS requires a restart to run the installed version. See the
[Tauri updater API](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/javascript/updater/) and
[signature verification implementation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/v2/plugins/updater/src/updater.rs).

Only the main window can check or download/install an update. It receives no
generic shell, filesystem, or HTTP plugin permission. Updater configuration
never permits insecure transport or invalid certificates.

## Local preparation

Provide real owner-controlled values through the shell environment. Do not
commit private keys, certificates, passwords, or generated release output.
The release commands do not create keys or publish artifacts. The optional
cryptographic fixture below creates disposable keys in memory only.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CADENCE_UPDATER_ENDPOINT` | Public HTTPS updater feed URL; no placeholder or embedded credentials |
| `CADENCE_UPDATER_PUBLIC_KEY` | Full base64 Tauri public-key content, not its filename |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` | Existing updater signing key, supplied directly to Tauri |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password when the key requires one |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | Valid `Developer ID Application:` identity installed in the local keychain |

Notarization also requires one complete credential set:

- `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD` (app-specific password), and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`; or
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`, `APPLE_API_KEY`, and `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH`.

Tauri documents these [signing and notarization credentials](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/macos/).
The release helper supports an installed local signing identity. Importing a
CI certificate or creating an Apple credential is a separate operation.

Install Xcode command-line tools, Python 3 (standard library only), and the
[Minisign verification tool](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) on the release
Mac. Minisign is a release tool; the app uses Tauri's built-in verifier.

From the repository root, use Node 24:

```bash
node apps/desktop/scripts/release.mjs check
node apps/desktop/scripts/release.mjs build
node apps/desktop/scripts/release.mjs verify apps/desktop/src-tauri/target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/bundle
```

`check` validates configuration, the local Developer ID identity, notarization
credentials, release tools, and `check-interactions.mjs --desktop-release`.
It does not contact the feed or prove credential acceptance by Apple. It fails
while applicable desktop interactions remain incomplete.

`build` checks candidate prerequisites without requiring final interaction
acceptance, writes public configuration under the ignored
`apps/desktop/.release/`, and invokes Tauri for `aarch64-apple-darwin` with app,
DMG, and signed updater artifacts. Tauri submits notarization during this
explicit build. The command performs local artifact verification afterward.
It never uploads a public release or changes a provider.
The Tauri child receives `CI=true` and `TAURI_BUNDLER_DMG_IGNORE_CI=false`, so
its [DMG helper](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/tauri-cli-v2.11.4/crates/tauri-bundler/src/bundle/macos/dmg/mod.rs)
skips Finder AppleScript as well as credential prompts. The
macOS disk-image service must still be available to the build process.

`verify` requires the public updater configuration and expected
`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`; it does not need private signing/notarization secrets.
It checks the app identifier/version/architecture, signing authority, hardened
runtime, code signatures,
Gatekeeper acceptance, and stapled notarization for the app and DMG. It decodes
Tauri's public-key/signature envelopes and asks Minisign to verify the updater
archive. It compares every file's bytes and permissions, directory, and symlink
target with the verified app. It rejects missing, surplus, duplicate, unsafe,
and unsupported entries without extracting archive-controlled paths. The resulting local JSON report lists
artifact hashes and explicitly excludes upgrade preservation and publication.

## Local signature fixture

With Minisign installed, run:

```bash
CADENCE_RELEASE_CRYPTO=1 npm exec -- vitest run tests/desktop-release-signature.test.ts
```

This opt-in test uses the same `verify-updater-signature.mjs` function as the
release command. Node creates disposable Ed25519 keys in memory and signs a
synthetic archive in Minisign's current prehashed format. Private keys never
leave memory. Only public keys, signatures, and synthetic archive data reach
temporary files, which the test and verifier remove.

On 2026-08-30, Minisign 0.12 accepted the unchanged archive and rejected changed
archive bytes, a different public key with the same key ID, a corrupted
signature, and an altered trusted comment. The helper also rejected malformed
base64. All six checks passed. Without `CADENCE_RELEASE_CRYPTO=1`, the ordinary
test suite skips this external-tool fixture. An opted-in run fails if Minisign
is missing; it never replaces verification with a mock.

This proves the local release verifier's cryptographic checks. Ticket 113
separately proved Tauri's installed preview update path and data preservation.
Developer ID signing, notarization, and notarized-DMG Gatekeeper acceptance
remain Ticket 115 requirements.

## Apple-trusted distribution (Ticket 115)

Tauri produces `Cadence.app.tar.gz` and its `.sig` beside the app. The updater
feed must use the `darwin-aarch64` platform entry, a newer SemVer version, the
public HTTPS archive URL, and the **contents** of the generated `.sig` file.
Do not substitute the signature filename. Use the
[Tauri updater format](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/). No feed or key is
invented by this implementation.

Ticket 115 is deferred because the owner cannot currently access the Apple
Developer Program or an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 14. Before production
distribution approval, record:

- Owner-authorized Apple Developer Program access.
- A valid Developer ID Application certificate and installed signing identity.
- Complete notarization credentials and successful Apple submission.
- Stapled notarization validation for both the app and DMG.
- All repository, desktop, shared-adapter, and interaction release checks.
- Actual WKWebView parity, offline launch, and native reminder evidence.
- Bundled font, image, and audio redistribution rights.
- Successful Gatekeeper launch from a quarantined downloaded notarized DMG.
- Actual execution and acceptance on Apple Silicon running macOS 14.
- Signature rejection after changing the archive or using a different key.
- User-controlled installation/restart and network-failure recovery.
- Stable profile/database identity, Notes, status/configuration/definition
  history, timing, provenance, outbox/cursors, and notification reconciliation
  after the upgrade.

Both Ticket 113 previews use SQLite schema 6, so live shipped-migration testing
is not applicable to that release. Existing native rollback tests remain current
evidence. The first future schema-changing desktop update must install an older
version and upgrade through the real updater with a protected database backup.
Do not create a disposable migration build or separate migration ticket now.

On 2026-08-31, `release.mjs check` loaded the existing public updater endpoint,
canonical public key, persistent private key path, and Keychain-held password.
Updater configuration, tools, and desktop parity passed. The command stopped
only on the missing Developer ID Application identity and complete notarization
credential set. No secret was printed or regenerated. Keep this failure as
Ticket 115 evidence; do not weaken the production checks.

Production publication requires the owner's release instruction. Passing the
local helper does not publish or satisfy Ticket 115.

The [2026-08-30 asset checklist](qa/2026-08-30-desktop-asset-provenance.md)
records the six image/audio files, hashes, and owner authorization. Bundled
font and Lucide notices are verified separately. The owner's 2026-08-31 statement
now authorizes all six exact files inside Cadence; that authorization does not
change MIT exclusions, trademark rights, or third-party notices.
