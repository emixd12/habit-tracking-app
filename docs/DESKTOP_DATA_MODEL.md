# Desktop data model

Schema version 10 adds the durable pre-attempt account snapshot to
`account_first_link_attempts`. Schema version 9 added the table after version 8 added
`account_sync_baselines` and schema version 7 added `account_link_metadata`.
The pending row preserves the attempt identity, pre-commit fingerprints, and
actual pre-attempt account snapshot through restart, retry, or cancellation.
This snapshot prevents a retry from confusing a post-attempt deletion with
preexisting absence. The baseline row stores the completed first-link
choice, deterministic idempotency key, local/hosted/common fingerprints, exact
canonical hosted snapshot, optional protected-backup path, and completion time.
It is written only after hosted commit and local atomic apply succeed. Exact
retries return the saved result; another baseline is rejected.

The local-profile-owned account metadata row maps
the stable local profile to one hosted user ID and may retain email and
authentication time. It stores no access token, refresh token, PKCE verifier,
pending state, provider credential, or synchronization choice. Ticket 121 owns
removal during disconnect.

Ticket 110 implements the local SQLite boundary. This document describes
implemented storage and explicit gaps. It does not establish complete desktop
parity or replace the web contract in `DATA_MODEL.md`.

## Database and migrations

`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/local_store` owns `cadence.sqlite3` in Tauri's
application data directory. The earlier `native-boundary-spike.sqlite3`
remains separate. Its `spike_read` and `spike_write` commands remain available.

The database uses foreign keys, WAL, a five-second busy timeout, and owner-only
file permissions on Unix. One transaction applies pending migrations and
records their version, name, exact source, and application time. A failed
migration rolls back its DDL and ledger writes. An altered applied migration or
newer database version stops opening; the application does not delete or reset
the database.

Ticket 117 exposes the exact `cadence.sqlite3` Application Support path without
allowing relocation. Native backup uses SQLite's online backup API, validates
integrity, foreign keys, stable profile, and exact migration history, then
atomically publishes the selected destination. Raw restore is local-mode only.
It validates and stages the selected snapshot, creates an owner-only protected
pre-restore backup under `Backups`, checkpoints and closes the live connection,
removes stale WAL/SHM sidecars, atomically replaces the main file, and reopens it.
Any replacement or reopen failure rolls back to the original database.

Migration `0001_current_local_model.sql` translates the current web Row
contracts through the August 2026 migrations. It does not replay only the
initial June schema. SQLite stores UUIDs and temporal values as text, booleans
as constrained integers, and JSON as validated text. Native IPC returns JSON
objects, arrays, booleans, and nullable values matching current web Row types.
Migration `0002_native_reminder_coverage.sql` adds durable verification receipts
without altering the already applied first migration.
Migration `0003_bound_behaviorlog_plans.sql` stores reviewed portability plans.
Migration `0004_status_history_cascade.sql` permits SQLite's revision-link cleanup
only while deleting an entire owning Occurrence. Direct history updates still
fail. Migration `0005_domain_preview_revision.sql` tracks actual domain changes
independently of reminder receipts and preview ledgers.
Migration `0006_passive_intervention_channels.sql` accepts the standard
BehaviorLog 0.3 Intervention channels and delivery statuses in passive imported
history. The shared importer still maps `planned` to stored `pending`.
The migration preserves existing rows, operational provenance links, domain
revision, and outbox entries. It keeps foreign keys enabled throughout its
transaction. Browser/email operational delivery constraints remain unchanged;
imported Interventions never schedule native requests.

Instants use UTC ISO strings ending in `Z`, with up to nine fractional digits.
Native comparisons preserve nanoseconds. Local dates use `YYYY-MM-DD`.
Wall times use `HH:mm:ss` with optional microseconds and no trailing fractional
zeroes. These canonical keys prevent equivalent textual times from defeating
uniqueness. TypeScript and Temporal own recurrence, timezone conversion,
normalization, duration arithmetic, and eligibility decisions.

## Local identity

Initialization commits one generated profile UUID, the current default
categories, an initial stale Occurrence sync state, and an initialization outbox
entry. Reopening preserves the UUID and does not recreate removed categories.
The single-profile unique index prevents a second local profile.

The profile keeps the current web Row shape. `email` is an empty string and
`display_name` is null on initialization. These fields do not represent cloud
identity or a notification recipient. The default timezone is
`America/New_York`. Defaults are Medical, Grooming, Fitness, Food / Drink,
Home, Measurements, Admin, and Other.

Every owned table has `user_id` referencing this profile. Composite foreign
keys also preserve Behavior, schedule, Occurrence, and history ownership.
Every IPC operation checks the supplied profile against the stable local
profile. SQLite has no Supabase Auth or RLS; those remain web responsibilities.

When the final native identifier is `app.cadence.desktop`, startup can adopt
`cadence.sqlite3` from its fixed `app.cadence.desktop-spike` Application Support
sibling. This is a one-time prototype identity transition. Startup leaves an
existing final database untouched. Both paths remain native; no IPC command
accepts an adoption source or destination.

Adoption holds a read snapshot and uses the SQLite online backup API, including
committed WAL pages. It validates database integrity, foreign keys, and the
single stable profile. It applies tracked migrations to a private staging copy,
checkpoints the copy, and publishes a complete file without replacing an
existing destination. The file uses owner-only permissions. The original
database remains available. Interrupted staging cannot become an empty new
profile; startup retries from the original database. Corruption, an invalid
profile, or a partial destination stops startup instead of silently seeding.
SQLite documents snapshot semantics in its [online backup API](https://www.sqlite.org/backup.html).

OS notification permission and requests do not migrate with the database.
The prototype app must cancel its requests before the identity transition.
The final app must obtain its own permission and reconcile actual OS readback.

## Stored tables

| Tables | Contract |
|---|---|
| `profiles`, `categories` | Stable local identity and current default category Rows |
| `behaviors`, `behavior_schedules`, `behavior_schedule_slots` | Full current Behavior graph, compatibility fields, custom and preset ranges, retained IDs and creation instants |
| `behavior_definition_events` | Definition history; updates cannot rewrite events |
| `behavior_configuration_events` | Configuration snapshots and deferred current-event pointer ownership |
| `occurrences` | Schedule snapshots, nullable configuration lineage, status snapshot, note, explicit local date |
| `occurrence_status_events` | Status history, predecessor references, provenance, timestamps |
| `occurrence_time_sessions` | Start/stop instants and at most one running session per Occurrence |
| `occurrence_sync_state` | Versioned local generation freshness and covered local-date range |
| `reminder_deliveries` | Existing browser/email contract and import provenance, without provider delivery |
| `native_reminder_state`, `native_reminder_coverage` | Desired native requests, retained cancellation intent, and explicit coverage receipts |
| `behaviorlog_import_runs`, `behaviorlog_import_record_mappings` | Current preview/apply metadata, accepted preview links, and record provenance |
| `imported_notes`, `imported_interventions` | Current passive imported context; no implicit reminder delivery |
| `behavior_revisions` | Native monotonic graph revision, outside the portable Behavior Row |
| `mutation_outbox`, `tombstones`, `sync_cursors` | Dormant sync scaffold; no network or conflict-resolution implementation |
| `behaviorlog_local_previews`, `local_data_revision` | Stored reviewed import plans and domain-only preview concurrency guard |
| `account_link_metadata`, `account_first_link_attempts`, `account_sync_baselines` | Nonsecret hosted identity mapping, pending first-link retry identity plus bounded pre-attempt snapshot, and completed common baseline; no authentication token |

Hosted-only Auth, push subscription, provider, and launch-rate-limit tables are
not copied. Import operations accept shared, explicit write plans. They do not
implement provider delivery or replay native reminder requests from exports.

Occurrence uniqueness is `(behavior_id, local_date, schedule_start_time,
schedule_range_identity)`. SQLite generates the range identity as `-1` for an
exact time and end-time microseconds for a range. Exact entries and ranges with
the same start remain distinct. Parent-slot start-time uniqueness matches the
current web schema.

## Native command

`local_store({ request })` accepts a typed, unknown-field-rejecting request.
Operation names and envelope fields use camelCase. Domain Rows use the current
snake_case web names. No request accepts SQL, a table name, or a file path.

Read operations execute within a consistent read transaction. Reads reject a
result above 100,000 rows instead of returning a partial result.

| Operation | Arguments after `operation` | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `readProfile` | none | `Profile` |
| `readCategories` | `profileId` | `Category[]` |
| `readBehaviorGraphs` | `profileId` | `{ behavior, schedules, slots, revision }[]` |
| `readOccurrence` | `profileId`, `occurrenceId` | `Occurrence` or null |
| `readOccurrences` | `profileId`, `startLocalDate`, `endLocalDate`, optional `behaviorId` | `Occurrence[]` |
| `readOccurrenceHistory` | `profileId`, `occurrenceIds` | `{ statusEvents, timeSessions }` |
| `readSyncState` | `profileId` | `OccurrenceSyncState` |
| `readExportSnapshot` | `profileId`, nullable `startLocalDate`, `endLocalDate`, `includeTimeTracking`, `throughStartedAt` | Categories, all Behavior graphs and definition/configuration histories, range Occurrences and linked status/reminder/time/native-reminder Rows |
| `readNativeReminderState` | `profileId` | `{ revision, reminders, coverage }` |
| `readImportSnapshot` | `profileId` | Consistent full domain/provenance Rows and domain `revision` |
| `readImportRuns` | `profileId`, `limit` from 1 through 100, optional `kind: import \| restore` | Recent full import-run Rows, filtered before limiting, descending by start instant and ID |

Every mutation also requires `profileId`, `mutationId`, and `now`. IDs and
planned row timestamps come from TypeScript. The native transaction checks
preconditions, applies the operation, and writes its request and result to the
outbox before committing. Repeating the same mutation ID and exact request
returns its previous result. Reusing an ID with a different plan fails.

| Operation | Additional arguments | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `createBehaviorGraph` | `graph`, `definitionEvent`, `configurationEvent` | Saved graph plus revision |
| `updateBehaviorGraph` | `graph`, `expectedRevision`, `expectedNormalizedDefinition`, nullable `definitionEvent`, nullable `configurationEvent` | Saved graph plus revision |
| `applyOccurrenceGeneration` | `behaviorId`, `expectedConfigurationEventId`, `create`, `update`, `delete` | Inserted, updated, and deleted counts |
| `applyStatusTransition` | `occurrenceId`, `expectedStatus`, `expectedLatestEventId`, next `status`, `completedAt`, `statusMarkedAt`, `cancelPendingReminders`, nullable full `event` Row | `{ statusChanged, concurrentDuplicate, occurrence, statusEvent }` |
| `updateOccurrenceNote` | `occurrenceId`, `expectedNote`, `note` | Saved Occurrence |
| `startTimeSession` | full `session` Row | Session or null when another session already runs |
| `stopTimeSession` | `occurrenceId`, `sessionId`, `stoppedAt` | Session or null when already stopped |
| `resetTimeSessions` | `occurrenceId`, full `expectedSessions` Rows | `{ deletedIds }` |
| `commitSyncState` | `expectedVersion`, full `state` Row | Saved state with native-incremented version |
| `updateProfileTimezone` | `expectedTimezone`, `expectedSyncVersion`, `timezone`, full active-graph `updates` | Saved Profile |
| `commitNativeReminderPlan` | `expectedRevision`, full `reminders` Rows, `cancelIds` | `{ revision, reminders, coverage }` |
| `recordNativeReminderCoverage` | `expectedRevision`, explicit `coverage`, `observed` results | `{ revision, reminders, coverage }` |
| `prepareBehaviorLogImport` | `expectedRevision`, full `previewRun`, nullable typed `plan` | `{ previewRun, revision }` |
| `applyBehaviorLogImport` | `previewRunId`, `importMode`, `previewFingerprint`, `localDataFingerprint`, `bundleFingerprint`, nullable `bundlePayloadFingerprint` | Status, full `importRun`, result or error, and `alreadyApplied` |

Mutation `graph` is `{ behavior: Behavior, schedules: BehaviorSchedule[],
slots: BehaviorScheduleSlot[] }`. It contains no nested slot arrays or revision.
Read results add the revision separately. `expectedNormalizedDefinition` is
`{ title, description }`; the shared resolver supplies it. This preserves the
web distinction between exact stored predecessor bytes and normalized history
text without duplicating JavaScript whitespace rules in Rust.

Generation `create` contains full planned Occurrence Rows. `update` contains
`{ expected: Occurrence, next: Occurrence }` pairs. `delete` contains the full
expected Rows. SQLite computes `schedule_range_identity`; clients cannot write
the generated value.

## Atomic guarantees

Graph revisions reject stale and ABA edits. A write validates owned parents,
nonempty schedule graphs, definition expectations, complete prior/next
configuration projections, and retained creation history. TypeScript owns
changed-field planning and normalization. A null definition event preserves
the exact stored title and description bytes. Retained time entries can swap
times or move to a retained/new parent without losing historical Occurrence
links. Retired entries receive tombstones. Every graph mutation marks
Occurrence sync state stale and increments its version.

Generation checks the exact current configuration event. It rejects changed
expected rows and duplicate inserts atomically. It preserves resolved rows,
rows at or before the injected instant, nonblank notes, timing history, and
unknown lineage on update. Updates preserve range identity and historical
creation/status/note fields. Generation itself does not change the sync-state
version. Final freshness commits compare the captured version, so an
intervening graph mutation cannot be hidden by a late successful sync.

Status writes compare both the current status and latest event ID. An immediate
concurrent duplicate follows the existing web result contract; a later ABA
history fails. Event, status snapshot, pending reminder cancellation intent,
and outbox write commit together. SQLite cancellation does not prove macOS
notification cancellation; the native reconciliation service must perform and
verify that external action. Note edits use exact expected-note comparison and
preserve configuration lineage.

Timing writes preserve status and reminder state. A partial unique index
prevents two running sessions for one Occurrence. Stop validates instant order.
Reset compares the full expected session set and commits deletion tombstones
with its outbox entry.

Timezone changes include every active Behavior exactly once. Each update is
`{ graph, expectedRevision, configurationEvent }`. The command checks the
profile timezone, sync version, graph revisions, and exact schedule/definition
preservation. A null event is valid only for an unchanged graph already using
the target timezone. Profile, changed Behavior rows, configuration history,
one sync-state invalidation, and outbox entry commit together. Archived
Behaviors and historical Occurrences remain unchanged. TypeScript validates
timezone semantics and plans later Occurrence regeneration.

Export reads hold one transaction across every returned collection. Definition
and configuration histories remain complete even when the requested Occurrence
range excludes their dates. Linked status, delivery, and native reminder rows
follow the Occurrence range. Optional time sessions must start at or before the
injected `throughStartedAt`; comparison preserves nanoseconds. Archived graphs
remain available for shared export filtering.

All-time export reads include every saved future Occurrence without generating
a new future horizon. Export snapshots also include passive imported notes,
passive interventions, applied import runs, and provenance mappings. Notes
still require the export option. Applied-run portability metadata retains
validated source configuration history, Occurrence timezone/lineage, and known
category registry values. Its 256 KiB limit rejects overflow. Preview ledgers
omit this metadata; retained history never becomes an OS notification request.

The native save command keeps the user-selected destination outside frontend
IPC. It writes an owner-only temporary file, synchronizes its contents,
replaces the destination atomically, and synchronizes the parent directory.
A directory synchronization failure reports that the new file was already
written; it does not claim that the previous file survived the replacement.

## Native reminder intent and coverage

`native_reminder_state` Rows contain `user_id`, `id`, `occurrence_id`,
`request_id`, `fire_at`, `title`, `body`, `status`, `error`, `verified_at`,
`created_at`, and `updated_at`. Request IDs use
`cadence.local.<occurrence UUID>`. The OS adapter accepts and enumerates this
owned namespace alongside the separate `cadence-spike.` test namespace.

The plan command requires future whole-second UTC instants, unverified
`planned` state, unresolved Occurrences, and enabled active Behaviors. The
shared resolver rounds future deadlines upward before submission. A plan
contains the entire desired set. Existing planned, scheduled, or failed Rows
must remain in the plan or appear in `cancelIds`. Cancellation IDs are local
reminder Row UUIDs; unknown UUIDs are idempotent no-ops. Cancelled rows remain
stored for retry. A failed OS cancellation preserves `cancelled` intent and
records its error. A plan commit never records successful OS scheduling.

Reminder reads expose the latest profile outbox sequence as `revision`.
Every plan and receipt compares `expectedRevision` under the write lock.
Every intervening data mutation invalidates existing coverage. An OS result
arriving after a data change cannot publish a stale successful receipt.
Idempotent mutation retries return their original result and revision.

Coverage Rows contain `user_id`, `status`, `target_through`,
`scheduled_through`, `first_unscheduled_at`, `expected_count`,
`scheduled_count`, `missing_ids`, `reason`, `verified_at`, `updated_at`, and
native-managed `dataset_revision`. Initial coverage is null. Status is
`complete`, `limited`, or `unverified`. The receipt argument omits `user_id`,
`updated_at`, and `dataset_revision`. Complete or limited receipts require an
explicit verification instant equal to the mutation's injected `now`;
unverified receipts require null. Shared TypeScript owns coverage assessment
from actual OS readback, including the earliest unscheduled deadline. Native
checks count/boundary consistency without deriving scheduling policy.

Receipt `observed` entries contain `{ id, status, error, delivery? }`, where
`id` is the local reminder Row UUID. A delivered observation requires exact
`delivery` evidence: `requestId`, `fireAt`, `title`, `body`, and `deliveredAt`.
Other observation statuses reject that evidence field. SQLite checks it
against the owned current Row and the receipt instant before committing.
Allowed observations are `scheduled`, `cancelled`,
`failed`, and `delivered`. Observations cannot reschedule cancelled intent.
Exact OS delivery evidence may correct a retired request to `delivered` for
history only, including when an earlier refresh retired it before the native
event drain. The desktop adapter validates the request identity, fire time,
content, and delivery instant against the current owned Row before writing
that observation. A replaced request's stale evidence must not match.
Failed persistence retains pending evidence for retry before expiry cleanup;
it must not silently discard the observation or claim user receipt/reading.
Readback or cancellation errors leave coverage unverified. SQLite cannot make
an OS action atomic with a data transaction; reconciliation and subsequent
readback remain necessary. Deleting an Occurrence cascades its native state
Rows. Reconciliation must also cancel enumerated product requests absent from
the desired set, including requests without a remaining SQLite Row.

## Reviewed import and restore plans

`readImportSnapshot` returns profile, categories, flat graphs with revisions,
definition/configuration/status histories, Occurrences, time sessions, reminder
Rows, import runs, provenance mappings, passive notes, and passive interventions
from one transaction. Each collection retains the 100,000-row rejection limit.
`readImportRuns` provides the smaller recent-ledger read used by page summaries.

Preview preparation writes only the preview ledger, plan binding, and outbox.
It never writes tracking records. The stored plan uses the shared
`LocalImportWritePlan` type: explicit graph writes, new definition/status events,
expected/next Occurrence and time-session Rows, category creates, passive
note/intervention writes and deletes, mappings, and a result summary. Graph
writes include a configuration-event chain ending at the exact final graph.
Native validation rejects unknown fields and accepts no SQL or table names.

An import preview may initially store a null plan while the user chooses a mode.
One later binding may replace null with a typed plan. That binding requires
identical preview ledger bytes and unchanged domain revision. A nonnull plan
cannot be changed or cleared. Apply accepts only the stored preview identity,
mode, and fingerprints; it cannot substitute another write payload. A missing
plan fails before any apply ledger or outbox write.

Domain revision advances through triggers on actual profile, category, graph,
Occurrence, history, timing, passive-context, and mapping changes. Reminder
intent, coverage receipts, sync-freshness metadata, preview bindings, and outbox
writes do not advance this revision. The reminder API separately retains its
global outbox revision. Background reminder reconciliation therefore does not
stale a reviewed import, while tracking changes still do. Shared TypeScript
computes the content fingerprints and plans from the captured snapshot.

Native apply checks exact expected Rows, graph revisions, parent ownership,
configuration lineage, current graph/event agreement, provenance targets, and
status predecessor cycles. Create-only cannot rewrite existing tracking data.
Merge can append schedules and accepted status/note effects, but cannot delete
tracking records or overwrite nonblank notes. Restore permits its explicit
typed replacements and deletes. Native validates destructive target IDs and
provenance mappings against stored restore actions. History Rows remain
append-only; deleting an accepted Occurrence may cascade its dependent history,
with deletion tombstones recorded in the same transaction.

Product writes run within a savepoint inside the operation transaction. A late
failure rolls back product changes, then records the failed apply ledger and
outbox result. A successful apply commits the ledger, mappings, tombstones,
domain changes, sync invalidation, and outbox together. Reapplying a stored
successful preview returns the original result. Failed plans require a new
preview before another attempt. Reviewed row timestamps stay fixed; the native
adapter records the actual apply ledger start/completion instants separately.

Imported interventions stay passive. Native reminder export extensions are not
accepted write-plan fields. Apply does not call an OS notification API, email
provider, or push provider. The desktop service must reconcile current native
reminder intent after an accepted tracking change.

## Verification and remaining work

Rust tests exercise real temporary SQLite databases, restart persistence,
outbox failure rollback, migration DDL rollback, graph revisions, range
uniqueness, status ABA and duplicate behavior, note protection, timing restart,
atomic reset tombstones, timezone transaction rollback, reminder revision races,
failed cancellation persistence, and export timestamp boundaries. The
feature-gated `local-store-contract` binary
provides a JSON-lines transport for real TypeScript adapter tests against this
same native boundary. It accepts a temporary database path only and is excluded
from normal builds. It does not expose a SQL operation.

`tests/desktop-store-contract.test.ts` exercises actual shared planning and
desktop adapters against the runner. Full shared local-Supabase/SQLite contract
coverage remains required before Ticket 110 completes.

Native accepted-plan import/merge/restore transactions are implemented. Shared
planner integration and actual TypeScript-to-SQLite parity tests remain required
before those user flows are complete. TypeScript reminder reconciliation
requires integration and OS lifecycle verification. Migration
recovery UI, full offline product QA, and signed release remain separate
gates. No provider calls, cloud identity, live sync, or background helper were
added.
