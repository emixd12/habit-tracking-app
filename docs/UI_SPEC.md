# UI Spec

## Design direction

Sparse, clean, checklist-like.

The app should feel like a personal cockpit, not a productivity platform.

Cadence is now a public product, but the authenticated app should not become
marketing-heavy. Public explanation, SEO content, standard adoption, and GitHub
links belong on the sibling Astro marketing site. The app remains direct and
work-focused after login.

Avoid:
- Dense dashboards
- Gamified streaks
- Social language
- Motivational copy
- Excessive modals
- Productivity-app sprawl

## Primary navigation

Use a fixed retractable sidebar on desktop and a drawer on mobile.

On desktop, the sidebar remains fixed while page content scrolls. Expanded
width is 16rem. Collapsed width is 4rem. Width changes animate over 200ms, and
the main content uses matching large-breakpoint left padding so content never
sits underneath the fixed rail.

The desktop sidebar uses a stable 64px icon column in both states. Header,
navigation, and footer account rows keep icons or avatar centered in that
column. Labels remain in the DOM and collapse visually with `opacity-0`,
`pointer-events-none`, `w-0`, and `overflow-hidden`; expanded labels use
`opacity-100` and `whitespace-nowrap`.
The desktop sidebar header does not draw a bottom divider. The Cadence mark and
name link to `/timeline`; the expanded-state collapse control stays separate
from the brand link. In the collapsed desktop rail, hovering the brand icon cell
swaps the Cadence mark to the open-sidebar icon. Brand links use a 70% opacity
state on hover and press.

Expanded navigation applies hover and active treatment to the whole row.
Collapsed navigation applies hover and active treatment only to the 64px icon
cell so the rail feels like square targets. The active route uses the Timeline
row hover fill with foreground text. Inactive hover uses the Surface fill.
Primary navigation rows should be flush with no gap between row containers.
The footer account region keeps the account row as a link to Settings. Directly
below it, render a quiet Sign out POST control with the same text and hover
treatment: icon plus label in the expanded desktop rail and mobile drawer, and
an icon-only cell with the accessible name and tooltip Sign out in the
collapsed desktop rail. Submitting from mobile closes the drawer.

On mobile, do not use the collapsed rail. Use a sticky 64px top header that
opens a left drawer. At the top of a page, the header does not draw a bottom
divider; as the page scrolls, a 1px Ash Line divider fades in over the first
short scroll distance so sticky-header separation appears only when content is
moving underneath it. The Cadence mark and name in the sticky header and drawer
header link to `/timeline`; the hamburger button remains the drawer opener. The
brand link uses a 70% opacity state on hover and press. The drawer is 60vw wide,
max 60vw, and closes from its backdrop, Escape, the close button, navigation, or
a left swipe. Opening from the first 20px viewport edge is supported. While
open, the drawer traps focus and locks body scrolling. A narrow drawer shadow
is allowed for separation from the backdrop. The mobile drawer header does not
draw a bottom divider.

Use four primary screens:

1. Timeline
2. Behaviors
3. Export & Import
4. Settings

The Timeline screen is the default screen after login.

Route:
`/timeline`

Categories should not appear in navigation or timeline filtering.

Behaviors, Export, and Settings may start with the shared decorative page
banner image as a full app-content-width banner. It may have a tiny top inset,
but should not add bottom margin. Timeline keeps its own decorative image
treatment and hides its visible page title so the current day remains first in
the feed.

## Public marketing site

The marketing site uses Cadence's existing product voice and design tokens, but
it is a separate Astro shell under `apps/marketing` rather than part of the
authenticated app shell.

Launch marketing routes:

- `/`
- `/cadence`
- `/standard`
- `/docs`
- `/examples`
- `/about`

Primary calls to action:

- Try Cadence
- Read BehaviorLog
- Download Example Bundle
- View on GitHub
- Log in

The marketing site should be SEO-conscious with semantic content structure,
metadata, canonical URLs, social preview metadata, sitemap/robots support, and
fast static pages. It also exposes `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, Markdown
mirrors, and a public route manifest for agents. Do not add heavy client-side
marketing interactions unless a specific page needs them.

Cadence should lead the homepage as the product and site brand. BehaviorLog is
the open bundle standard and portability layer behind Cadence exports and
imports. Keep the existing Cadence mark, use the square ledger visual system,
and show only the Cadence logo and name in the marketing header. The stable
route `/standard` may remain, but visible navigation should call the page
BehaviorLog. Launch header navigation should show only Cadence and BehaviorLog
route links plus Log in; About belongs in the footer, and Docs/Examples remain
direct or in-page links rather than top navigation links. Marketing header
links use the same underlined text-action convention as content buttons,
without a divider under the header. The persistent Log in action uses the same
primitive with stronger weight to distinguish it from the route links.

No public design-system page is launch scope. `/design-system` remains
dev-only.

## Timeline screen

This is the main screen.

The current day should be prominent and should begin the forward timeline.

Do not show a visible Timeline page title or explanatory helper text above the
feed. A decorative transparent Cadence horse-line-and-dot image may sit
directly above the feed with no extra top or bottom margin and span the full app
content width; the first Timeline day section should still be the current-day
section.
Optional first-run setup appears as a dismissible pop-up so it does not push the
feed down while required launch setup items remain incomplete.

### First-run setup

The first-run prompt is a fixed, non-modal pop-up shown on Timeline only while
required setup items remain incomplete and the user has not dismissed it in the
current browser. It should:

- Sit below the sticky mobile header on narrow screens and remain scrollable
  when the setup rows exceed the available height.
- Link to the existing create-behavior, notification, timezone, and import
  controls.
- Treat import as optional.
- Never request notification permission on page load.
- Use compact list rows, quiet dividers, and factual state labels such as Done,
  Not enabled, Blocked, Confirmed, Review, and Optional.
- Provide a Skip setup control.
- Avoid motivational copy, progress gamification, an inline takeover, or a
  wizard.
- Treat a denied or blocked browser notification permission as a completed
  onboarding decision while still showing the factual Blocked label when the
  prompt is otherwise visible.

Users should not browse previous days as normal timeline sections. Prior
unresolved occurrences appear only in the Needs decision modal, with one narrow
exception: prior-day occurrences resolved today may remain visible in that
modal through the current local day so the user can correct an accidental tap.

Timeline access:

### Needs decision

Unresolved occurrences before today.

Needs decision is a derived UI state, not a stored occurrence status.

Needs decision should not interrupt the forward Timeline flow. It is opened from a floating button fixed to the lower right of the Timeline screen.

The floating button should:
- Show the number of prior unresolved occurrences.
- Use the reserved fixed-action treatment when there is at least one occurrence to decide.
- Remain factual and non-punitive. Do not use error styling or missed/failure language.
- Use one continuous surface without an internal divider between the number and text.
- On mobile, span the lower safe-area width as one bottom action so it stays easy to reach without covering the feed.
- Open a modal that reveals all prior unresolved occurrences grouped by local day.

The open modal should be led by the day feed, not by a global title or global
count. Keep the close control pinned over the modal's top-right corner without
reserving a header row; the first date group should start at the top of the
scroll area. The scroll area should keep equal left and right gutters to the
outer modal container; only the date header text row may reserve space for the
overlaid close control. Each date group should show the local date first, then a
line with how many unresolved occurrences are left to decide for that date. Date
groups use the normal white background rather than a grey container.

After the user resolves a prior-day occurrence, that row should remain in its
original local-day group until the next local midnight in the user's timezone
when its `status_marked_at` falls on the current local date. This retention is
derived from existing status timing and applies to any prior-day occurrence
resolved today; do not add a stored modal-origin flag. Do not move retained
rows into a separate "Decided just now" or similar section. Completed rows keep
the same full blue Completed state used on Timeline rows; expanding the row
exposes Change status and Note editing. Not Completed rows keep the same
resolved-row behavior as Completed rows: full red accent treatment, a collapsed
Not Completed label, and status correction from the expanded row. The Needs decision count
continues to count unresolved prior-day occurrences only, not retained decided
rows. When there are no unresolved rows but retained decided rows still exist,
the button may still open the modal with a zero count and should clarify that
the modal is reviewing decisions from today. Date groups with retained rows and
zero unresolved items should say `None left to decide`, without calling the
past group today. Retention
must be derived from existing occurrence status timing and the local day
boundary; do not add a stored status or flag for it.

Example:

```text
Needs decision
Yesterday
- Brush teeth
- Take medication

Monday
- Laundry
```

### Current day

Current-day occurrences, ordered by scheduled time.

When the same behavior has multiple occurrences on the same local day, group
those same-day occurrences together as a stack. Groups are ordered by their
earliest occurrence. Each scheduled time or time range renders as its own
occurrence row inside the group.

For multi-time behavior groups:
- Do not use percentage or progress fill on the grouped row.
- Keep the existing single-occurrence visual language for each row.
- Completed rows use the existing full blue completed treatment.
- Unresolved rows use the existing unresolved treatment and show Completed and
  Not Completed text-link status actions.
- Not Completed rows use the red accent treatment, show the collapsed Not
  Completed label, and hide primary status actions just like Completed rows.
- Do not show a "1 of 2 completed" label.
- Do not add a partial-completion stored status.
- Partial completion is only a derived visual result of mixed row states within
  the grouped behavior.
- Status actions always apply to the specific occurrence row where they appear.

Example:

```text
Saturday, June 6
9:00 AM  Take medication
11:00 AM Drink matcha
10:00 PM Brush teeth
```

If a day has no scheduled behaviors, show:

```text
No behaviors on this day
```

### Future days

Show the next 7 days by default.

Each future day is its own section.

Provide a control to show more future days.
When the user reveals more future days, preserve useful scroll context instead
of sending the user back to the top of the Timeline.

Do not show previous days except for unresolved prior-day items inside the Needs decision modal.

## Disclosure controls

Use native `details` and `summary` for hide/show sections and drawer-like
detail areas when the browser primitive fits the interaction. The `summary`
element is the product disclosure trigger button and should use the shared
disclosure-trigger styling rather than a one-off cursor, marker, or underline
treatment. Sections that need an explicit opener use the shared disclosure
indicator; Timeline occurrence rows omit a separate indicator because the whole
row summary is the trigger.

Disclosure content spacing should be owned by the disclosure pattern or the
surface-specific row pattern, not by ad hoc per-instance padding. Timeline row
details keep the standardized 16px optical gap from the collapsed row text to
the first detail label.

## Occurrence card

Collapsed card should show:
- Scheduled time
- Behavior title
- Current status when Completed or Not Completed
- Completed and Not Completed text-link status actions when unresolved

Preset time-range occurrences should use the short preset label in collapsed
Timeline rows, such as Morning or Evening, without the full clock range.

Status text-link actions should be underlined by default with the same thin underline. On hover-capable devices or keyboard focus, the action text may gain non-reflowing emphasis without changing color or moving adjacent actions. Do not use underline thickness to indicate a saved status.

Occurrence rows should read as compact unboxed list rows. Do not draw a perimeter border around each Timeline behavior row. Row content should keep a compact horizontal inset on both desktop and mobile so filled row states do not press text or status labels against the row edges.

In collapsed rows, the scheduled time, behavior title, and collapsed status/action text should be vertically centered within the row. Expanded rows may pin the status controls to the top-right so the details panel can span the row below.
On mobile, scheduled time, behavior title, Completed, and Not Completed should share one horizontal row when unresolved status actions are visible. Completed and Not Completed keep at least a 44px tap target and same-line labels while still looking like underlined text actions; the scheduled time and behavior title may compact and truncate before the status targets shrink. Do not add a chevron or separate disclosure icon.

Expanded card details should stay inside the native disclosure element and show:
- Description if present
- Category
- Behavior schedule
- Note field
- Option to change a Completed or Not Completed status.

Categories should only be visible in the expanded card details.

Unresolved prior-day cards in the Needs decision modal should be visually highlighted so the user is clearly prompted to decide whether each occurrence was Completed or Not Completed. This highlight is derived from date and status; it must not write a different status.

Completed cards should remain visible with a distinct resolved state, hide the primary status actions, and clearly indicate Completed.

Not Completed cards should remain visible with the red accent treatment and a
collapsed Not Completed label. They should match Completed row structure except
for color and label; status correction remains available after expanding the
row. This is a factual recorded-state cue only; the stored status remains on
that occurrence instance as `not_completed`, and the UI must not call it missed
or failed.

Clicking a Completed or Not Completed card should reveal the option to change
the logged action. Do not require a confirmation step before changing a status.

Notes, category, description, and schedule details are hidden by default and revealed when the user clicks the card outside the status actions.
Expanded details should sit directly on the background surface without a grey
panel, enclosing border, top divider, or boxed card treatment. Use a small left
inset for the detail block. Measure spacing optically between rendered text and
field edges: the largest gap is between the collapsed row content and the first
detail label and should measure 16px optically. This gap is part of the
standard disclosure pattern for row details. The next-largest gap is between
detail pairs, and the smallest gap is shared by detail label/value, Note
label/textarea, and textarea/Save note
relationships. The Note textarea keeps its field border, but Save note uses the
same underlined text-action vocabulary as Completed and Not Completed.
When an occurrence is open, the whole occurrence row should hold the same blue
background used by that row's hover state so the expanded content remains
visually attached to the behavior.

Status action behavior:
- Completed changes status to `completed`
- Not Completed changes status to `not_completed`
- A successful user-initiated change into Completed may play a short completion chime.
- Do not play a sound for Not Completed, note saves, page refreshes, or re-saving an already Completed occurrence.
- Note opens an inline edit field or compact modal in the expanded card state

Resolved occurrences can be changed later.

## Behavior form

The create/edit behavior view should be a full page accessible from the sidebar navigation.

On the Behaviors page, the create form should sit in the page flow without an
extra outer card border or outer padding. Inner field groups may still use
quiet dividers where they clarify structure.

Fields:
- Title
- Description
- Category
- Schedule with one or more rows; each row has recurrence, every/details,
  times, and time mode
- Browser notifications enabled, default on
- Email reminder toggle, default off
- Reminder offset
- Active/archive

At least one schedule and one time entry are required. Add time is plain black
text under the schedule row and adds another exact time or range to the same
recurrence. Add schedule is underlined black text and creates another
recurrence row. Keep the section unboxed with thin dividers and inline fields.
Do not show decorative clock, bell, or info icons in the form body. Separate
Reminders from Schedule with a thin divider. The primary submit action is Save
behavior; Cancel is a secondary text action. Cancel restores the complete draft
to the values present when the create or edit form opened, including identity,
recurrence, schedule rows, exact times or ranges, reminder choices, and active
state. It does not persist any of the discarded edits.

Preset time ranges:
- Morning: 6:00 AM-Noon
- Afternoon: Noon-6:00 PM
- Evening: 6:00 PM-Midnight
- Night: Midnight-6:00 AM

Timezone is managed in Settings and should not be shown as a separate panel in
the behavior creation form.

Public launch includes a short first-run onboarding flow. It reuses the same
behavior form, notification permission control, import entry, and timezone
settings rather than creating a separate onboarding product.

## Recurrence editor

Support:
- Daily
- Every N days
- Weekly on selected weekdays
- Every N weeks on selected weekdays
- Monthly on day N

Use segmented presets first, with advanced options below.

The Recurrence editor should be an unframed form section, not a boxed panel.
Use smaller subsection heading text for options such as Every, On, and Day.

Do not expose raw cron syntax.

Do not use natural language parsing in v1.

## Reminder editor

Behavior-specific fields:
- Browser notifications enabled, default on
- Email reminder toggle, default off
- Reminder offset:
  - At scheduled start
  - 15 minutes before
  - 1 hour before
  - 1 day before
  - 3 days before
  - Custom minutes/hours/days if easy

Browser notification permission is managed globally from Settings. The Settings
save control should call the browser permission request from the user's click
when permission is still undecided, save a subscription after permission is
allowed, and show factual unblock copy when the browser reports permission is
blocked.

Behavior-level browser reminders represent intent for that behavior. They rely
on devices enabled in Settings; if the current device is not enabled or browser
notifications are blocked, the behavior remains trackable.

The Reminder editor should use the same unframed form-section treatment as the
Recurrence editor. Use a plain section heading and smaller subsection heading
text for options such as Reminder offset.

## Behaviors screen

Behaviors is the primary behavior object surface. It combines recurring
behavior setup, compact active behavior metadata, range-based adherence, and
behavior date review. This is a UI composition change only: it must not add
schema, stored statuses, duplicate resolver logic, or date/time mutation for
occurrences.

Overall adherence appears near the top of the Behaviors screen with compact
7 / 30 / 90 day underlined text-action range controls directly above the
overall calendar inside that same area. The overall calendar remains passive;
selecting days for correction starts from an individual behavior row.

Show active behaviors first as compact unboxed rows.

The behavior creation form should be available from the Behaviors page without
pushing existing behavior cards far below the first viewport. When behaviors
already exist, keep creation behind a simple in-page disclosure. When no
behaviors exist, the creation disclosure may open by default.

Each behavior card/list item should keep the repeatedly used review information visible:
- Title
- Range-based adherence label plus Completed and Not Completed counts when occurrences exist in the selected range
- A per-behavior calendar/heatmap sized to the row
- Archive behavior at the end of Details and Settings
- Restore for archived behaviors
- Details and Settings

The Details and Settings disclosure should reveal lower-use behavior
configuration fields such as category, scheduled times or ranges, recurrence
summary, reminder indicators, and description when present, then expose the
existing edit form. These characteristics should not take over the collapsed
behavior row.

Behavior records should not draw a perimeter border. Separate adjacent
behaviors with a single quiet divider line, and keep borders only on real
fields, controls, and status labels. Archive behavior belongs at the end of
Details and Settings for active records; on desktop, align it with the
Save/Cancel footer row on the opposite side of the settings area. Restore
remains available from archived records. Archive uses the Rust Signal danger
text-action, while Restore uses the primary underlined text-action rather than
bordered button chrome.
Separate behavior settings edits from behavior date review:

- Details and Settings opens the existing behavior metadata and edit form
  for recurring behavior configuration: title, description, category,
  recurrence, schedule, reminders, and active/archive state.
- Behavior date review opens from a selected non-empty per-behavior calendar
  cell and is for reviewing or correcting dated records only.
- Non-empty per-behavior calendar cells should expose action scent through
  accessible labels or titles such as "open day review"; empty cells remain
  passive.
- Behavior date review displays Date of behavior, Time of behavior, Status, and
  Note as plain rows.
- Date of behavior and Time of behavior are display-only in date review.
- Status and note correction controls stay hidden behind a per-occurrence
  Review disclosure until the user chooses to review that occurrence.

Archived behaviors should not appear in the main active behavior feed or on the
timeline. They should sit at the bottom of the Behaviors screen behind a
low-priority Archived behaviors disclosure with a count, where Restore remains
available.

Archive and Restore change the behavior's durable active state and mark the
occurrence/reminder graph stale in one transaction. If either write fails, both
roll back. After that transaction commits, the behavior-state change remains
successful when immediate repair fails because background processing can retry
from the durable stale marker.

Category editing belongs in Settings.

## Behavior review details

Default range:
- Last 30 days

Show:
- Overall adherence at the top of Behaviors
- Completion-intensity calendar heatmap for overall adherence
- Date range selector: 7 / 30 / 90 days as underlined text actions. The current
  range uses primary black text, and inactive ranges use readable muted text.
- Completed and Not Completed counts by behavior
- Per-behavior chart or calendar heatmap
- Tracking-since date for each behavior count row in MM-DD-YY format, plus a
  start marker in that behavior's calendar when the start day is inside the
  selected range
- Full completion, partial completion, and not completed day states for behaviors that can occur multiple times in one day
- Behavior date review for correcting individual statuses and notes
- Top summary Unresolved count when the count is greater than zero
- Optional compact resolved counts by category
- Default adherence rate

The Behaviors screen's review area should read as one sparse report surface. Avoid boxed
section panels around Overall adherence, the calendar, Behavior counts, and
Category counts. Use single horizontal dividers where separation is needed.
The overall calendar belongs inside the Overall adherence area. The date range
selector sits directly above that calendar. The overall adherence label uses a
colon, and the percentage sits immediately after it on the same unbroken header
line at desktop widths. The selected date range appears directly underneath in
compact muted month-day wording. The range selector, calendar, and vertically
listed legend form one cluster aligned to the right edge on desktop.

The overall calendar is a passive adherence summary, not the correction entry
point. Later corrections start from a behavior row: selecting a non-empty
behavior calendar cell opens a compact Behavior date area inside that behavior
row. Its heading should be explicit, such as Review selected day, rather than a
generic Review label. The behavior date review should list only that behavior's
occurrences for the selected local date when rows exist, including Completed,
Not Completed, and Unresolved rows. It should use plain text labels for Time of
behavior, Status, and Note rather than chips, and empty notes should read as
italic No note. Correction controls stay hidden behind a per-occurrence Review
disclosure until the user chooses to review that occurrence. Inside the
disclosure, Change status and the Completed / Not Completed actions should sit
on one row when space allows. A resolved occurrence also exposes Clear decision
in this behavior-date context, returning it to Unresolved. An expanded,
just-decided Timeline occurrence exposes the same correction as Unmark; Needs
decision does not expose it as a global action. Both labels use the same status
service and restore only still-future reminders. The inline Note form follows
the status controls. Do not use
internal divider lines that visually compete with the behavior-row separators.
Do not add bulk edit, all-time search, automatic suggestions, AI coaching, or
gamified language. Do not render an empty review panel when the selected
behavior day has no occurrences.

Default adherence excludes unresolved occurrences. When shown, the top summary
Unresolved count matches the Timeline Needs decision count: active unresolved
occurrences before the current local day, regardless of the selected Behaviors range.
Hide the top summary Unresolved row when the count is zero.
Current-day unresolved occurrences can still show as unresolved in heatmap
cells and behavior date review rows. Do not render an Unresolved row in
per-behavior or category count grids.

Overall calendar cells use completion intensity for completed share: 100%
Completed uses the full primary blue, and lower completion shares mix that blue
with the background in the same proportion. A 50% completed day should appear
as a half-strength blue cell. A day with resolved occurrences but no completed
occurrences uses the red accent treatment. Fully unresolved days use the
neutral unresolved treatment.

Behavior count rows should be divider-separated rather than boxed. Their
Completed and Not Completed labels align vertically with numeric values in the
same left-start value column used by other behavior-row metadata, and visible
count rows use the same compact vertical spacing as the metadata inside Details
and Settings. Behavior calendar cells with occurrences are selectable; empty
cells remain passive.
Behavior categories appear as plain metadata text inside Details and edit
settings.

Overall and behavior calendar cells show a compact date label on hover or
keyboard focus while preserving the longer accessible label for screen readers
and native titles.

## Export & Import screen

Route:
`/export`

The screen label is Export & Import. Keep `/export` as the stable route.

Top-level sections:
- Export
- Import

Export options should appear before download links and the AI summary so every
output reflects the same selected state. The selected range scope counts belong
inside Options rather than a separate Current export section.

Export options:
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Last 90 days
- All time
- Include archived behaviors
- Include occurrence notes, off by default
- Selected range scope: behavior count, occurrence count, and default adherence

Export outputs:
- Export JSONL
- Export CSV
- Export app JSON snapshot
- Export BehaviorLog bundle
- Copy AI summary
- Download AI summary as `.md`

Downloads should render as compact label/action rows. Put the extension next to
the format name, keep the Download action on the same row when space allows,
and include one concise task-based guidance line per format: JSONL for scripts
and agents, CSV for spreadsheet review, app JSON for app-native snapshots, and
BehaviorLog for complete portability and restore-oriented status history. Omit
icons and row borders. Do not render download actions as explanatory card
grids.

Exports should support both download and copy where practical.

The AI summary is an export artifact, not an in-app coaching feature. It should
state whether notes are included and should show notes only when the user opts
into occurrence notes.

Analysis prompts appears after the AI summary inside the Export section. It is
a static, single-column library of native disclosure rows. Collapsed rows show
the prompt title and one factual purpose sentence. Expanded rows show the
required export format or options, the full prompt in a preformatted Cold
Surface panel, and an underlined Copy prompt text action. Copy feedback appears
next to the action through an `aria-live="polite"` status with Copied or Copy
unavailable. Keep all copy in sentence case and factual, with no icons, warning
box, or caution chrome. The muted intro includes the plain sensitivity
disclosure that whatever the export contains becomes visible to the assistant
the user pastes it into.

Do not use icons in Export & Import page controls unless a later design-system
ticket reintroduces a specific icon affordance.

BehaviorLog import should live in the Import section as a sparse ledger panel.
The section accepts `.behaviorlog.zip` uploads, shows validation errors and
warnings before any product write, shows dry-run counts, privacy notes, note
sensitivity warnings, intervention preview counts, passive imported
intervention storage counts, dropped/redacted intervention field summaries,
unsupported field counts, imported-note record counts, inline occurrence-note
fill counts, and merge actions, and requires explicit confirmation before
applying create-only or supported user-approved merge plans.
If high or restricted sensitivity notes would be imported, apply controls must
also require a dedicated privacy acknowledgement. Do not add generalized notes
browsing or intervention-to-reminder writes in this screen.

Import and restore show and enforce a 2 MB bundle limit before submission and
on the server, plus bounded archive-entry, extracted-size, and compression-ratio
safety limits. The Next.js Server Action ceiling is 4 MB: a 2 MB ZIP is about
2.7 MB after base64 encoding, leaving margin below Vercel's 4.5 MB Function
request cap. Apply submits the base64 archive once. Action state carries only
the SHA-256 fingerprint of the exact previewed archive bytes.

Import apply controls must remain bound to the persisted accepted merge-preview
run currently being reviewed. The server first verifies the submitted archive's
SHA-256 against the accepted raw-archive fingerprint, then authoritatively
re-parses and verifies matching bundle, local-data, and combined preview
fingerprints before any write. When that verification
refuses an unaccepted, stale, altered, or mismatched preview, show the refusal
as an alert, retain the reviewed preview, and require the user to generate and
accept a fresh preview. Do not silently replace the reviewed plan or provide a
global bypass. Keep each Apply control disabled until the user has reviewed the
exact preview and completed every sensitivity acknowledgement required for that
preview; native required validation remains a secondary safeguard.

BehaviorLog restore preview may also appear in the Import section when a restore
ticket is active. It should stay separate from create-only and merge import,
show create/replace/archive/delete/keep/skip counts, highlight destructive
replace/archive/delete actions, show non-restorable account/provider/browser
fields, show note sensitivity and intervention redaction warnings, and display
the preview fingerprint needed for stale-preview refusal. Preview itself must
not present as a completed restore and must not write product records.

Restore apply controls should appear only after a valid restore preview. They
must require a fresh-backup checkbox, typed `RESTORE` confirmation, and a
separate high/restricted note sensitivity acknowledgement when relevant. The UI
should show stale-preview or unsupported-action refusal as an alert and keep the
preview visible for review. Keep Apply restore disabled until all applicable
gates are satisfied. Apply result or failure details should appear in the
Restore section history.

## Settings screen

Show:
- Profile/email from Google sign-in when available
- Timezone
- Notification permission status
- Control to request browser notification permission
- Global browser notification setting
- Global email notification setting if needed
- Lightweight category editing
- Export/backup links if not on Export page
- Trust, Privacy, and Terms links for public-product account context
- Account deletion with export acknowledgement and typed confirmation

Timezone detection should use the browser/OS timezone exposed by `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`; do not request geolocation or location permission. Settings should present one native select of IANA timezones whose selected value is the stored timezone; the select is the only "current timezone" display, with no separate stored or browser-detected value rows. When the detected browser timezone differs from the current selection, show a single quiet Detected line with an inline Use detected timezone action; when they match or detection is unavailable, show nothing. If the browser cannot enumerate timezones, fall back to manual IANA timezone entry. Before submit, Settings should state that saving a timezone updates the profile and active behavior schedules, then resyncs future unresolved occurrences while preserving past and resolved history.

Do not include a test notification button in v1.

Do not include destructive data actions in v1 except the explicit public-launch
account deletion path and dedicated BehaviorLog restore work. Restore preview is
read-only; restore apply must require explicit review, backup acknowledgement,
typed confirmation, and stale-preview refusal before destructive writes.
The account deletion action should stay disabled in the client until both the
export acknowledgement and typed confirmation match, while server-side
validation remains authoritative.

Notification, behavior archive/restore, and account-deletion action results
must use one concise live result per action. Successful results use status
semantics; failures use alert semantics. Do not announce the same message from
multiple live regions. After successful account deletion redirects to Login,
the `Account deleted.` status receives focus so the result is announced on the
destination page. Unsupported, blocked, dismissed, or otherwise unsuccessful
notification-enable attempts use alert semantics; passive availability details
