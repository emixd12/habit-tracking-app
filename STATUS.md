# Implementation Status

## Function

`STATUS.md` is the current-state ledger for this repository. Future agents should read it immediately after `AGENTS.md` and before selecting work from `docs/TICKETS.md`.

Its job is to answer:

- What has already been implemented?
- What is currently in progress?
- What is blocked, deferred, or intentionally not started?
- Which verification commands were run for completed work?
- Which files, docs, or contracts changed during each ticket?
- What risks or follow-up items should the next agent know before continuing?

`STATUS.md` does **not** replace the product docs. It does not define feature scope, product behavior, UI requirements, data contracts, or source-of-truth precedence. Use:

- `AGENTS.md` for operating rules and source-of-truth order.
- `docs/TICKETS.md` for ticket scope and acceptance criteria.
- The other files under `docs/` for product, data, recurrence, notification, export, UI, and user-flow contracts.
- `STATUS.md` only for implementation state and handoff continuity.

## Update rules

Update this file whenever a ticket starts, completes, becomes blocked, is reopened, or materially changes scope.

Use these status values:

- `not_started`: No implementation work has begun.
- `in_progress`: Work has begun but is not complete or verified.
- `blocked`: Work cannot continue until a specific dependency or decision is resolved.
- `complete`: Acceptance criteria are satisfied and required verification has run, or unavailable commands are explicitly noted.
- `deferred`: Work is intentionally postponed and should not be implemented in v1 unless the docs change.

When updating a ticket row:

1. Keep the ticket scope anchored to `docs/TICKETS.md`.
2. Record key files changed, not every trivial file.
3. Record verification commands with pass/fail status.
4. Record blockers and follow-ups as concrete next actions.
5. Do not mark a ticket `complete` if `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, or `npm run build` failed or could not be run without explanation.
6. Do not use this file to expand v1 scope. Put future ideas in `docs/FUTURE_UPDATES.md` unless a user explicitly moves them into scope.

## Current repository state

The numbered implementation sequence is complete through Ticket 065. Ticket
066 continues the Locust infrastructure stress-testing roadmap with an
approval-gated hosted capacity run. Ticket 067 is `blocked`; its local
launch cost guardrails and traffic-surge operations are implemented, while its
owner-policy and provider acceptance gates remain unresolved. It adds no product
billing or an admin dashboard. Tickets 068, 069, and 070 are complete. Ticket
070 adds privacy-gated time-tracking exports after the Timeline
stopwatch capture/reset and compact Behaviors timing context. Ticket 068 may
proceed locally without the provider gates blocking Tickets 066-067; Ticket 070
follows Ticket 069 so export aggregation reuses the settled Behaviors semantics.
Ticket
063's local-only harness, registry-derived workload manifest, authenticated
protocol proof, and exact disposable-account cleanup are implemented and
verified. Ticket 064's independent synthetic identities, realistic read
cohorts, bounded local baseline/ramp/recovery, integrity gates, and exact
cleanup are also implemented and verified. The only
human-gated interaction-audit item at this frontier is IA-024, which needs a
product decision before onboarding dismissal can change from origin-global
browser storage to account-specific storage. Workspace restructuring,
desktop/mobile, PWA/offline, billing, and AI/speech work remain deferred or
unticketed.

Ticket 071 is complete. Mobile Timeline now supports a guarded pull-to-refresh,
one confirmed transition to Completed makes one completion-chime playback
attempt, and expanded resolved labels remain parallel to the behavior title.
The owner explicitly approved adding the source screenshots to the repository
on 2026-08-04. Chromium touch QA passed. Mobile WebKit and an authenticated
physical-device pass remain unverified because those browser surfaces were not
available in this environment.

Tickets 078 and 095-097 are `complete` locally under explicit owner direction
on 2026-08-14. Ticket 078 prevents Behavior edits from deleting unresolved
Occurrences at or before the current instant or future unresolved Occurrences
with notes or tracked time. Tickets 095-097 add append-only Behavior
configuration history, Occurrence-to-revision lineage, and rich-export schedule
history without adding medication dose or clinical semantics. Clean migration
reset, authenticated RLS smoke coverage, real 1,001-row Data API pagination,
949 tests passed with one environment-gated integration test skipped. Lint,
typecheck, build, and repository checks passed. Hosted migration deployment
remains unauthorized and was not performed.

Tickets 079-083 and 093 are `complete` locally. Tickets 084-092 are `not_started`. Ticket 094 is `complete`. Tickets 078-093
were defined on 2026-08-06 from a repository-wide read-only audit across five
independent passes (domain resolvers/services/repos, routes/auth/API,
import/restore/export, UI/interaction, schema/marketing/ops). No fix was applied
during the audit and no product scope changed. Scope and acceptance criteria
live in `docs/TICKETS.md`; the remaining suggested order starts with Ticket
084.
Ticket 094 was added on 2026-08-12 after the live 90-day Behaviors range
produced an oversized Supabase Data API URL. It replaces Ticket 091's earlier
chunked-table-query decision with two owner-scoped query contracts: a bounded
arbitrary-ID RPC with automatic batching, and a joined date-range/keyset-cursor
RPC for historical Analytics and Export reads. Local implementation and
verification completed on 2026-08-12. The owner authorized and completed the
migration-first hosted rollout on 2026-08-12. Authenticated production QA
passed for every required caller, so the production defect is resolved.

Ticket 082 caps one account at 20 active push subscriptions through an
owner-serialized database trigger. The 21st registration keeps the new row and
evicts the LRU row. Reminder fan-out reads at most 20 rows and uses four
concurrent workers. A distributed authenticated-account limiter allows six
registration attempts per 60 seconds without resetting the separate auth-
failure limiter. Sign out discovers existing browser PushManager endpoints and
deactivates the departing account's current-device row before local session
clear. A clean migration reset, generated-type comparison, focused 74-test
suite, local 21st-row/concurrency/two-account smoke, 991-test full suite with
one environment-gated skip, lint, typecheck, build, repository checks, and diff
check passed. The first sandboxed full-test run failed only because the existing
fake provider could not bind loopback; the permission-enabled rerun passed. No
hosted migration, application deployment, provider contact, or push send was
performed. Two intermediate reset attempts applied every migration but received
a local gateway 502 during container restart. A non-destructive local
Supabase stop/start restored health; the final clean reset and smoke passed.

Ticket 083 makes both destructive Settings writes preserve a recoverable
boundary. Account deletion validates both gates, verifies the service-role
client, hard-deletes the Auth user, then attempts global sign-out. Verification
or deletion failure leaves the account and session intact. A post-delete
sign-out error does not turn completed deletion into a false retry state.
Settings timezone save reuses the Ticket 095-097 history-aware transaction.
Migration `20260825075255_fix_settings_timezone_conflict_errors.sql` changes
its stale preconditions from retryable `40001` to non-retryable `P0001` without
weakening configuration history. Authenticated local smoke proves rollback
after the profile update, one configuration event, and one sync-state version
increment. Clean reset, 1,000 tests with one environment-gated skip, lint,
typecheck, build, repository checks, and local advisors pass. No hosted action
occurred.

Ticket 098 is `complete` with release decision `PASS`. Ticket 099 is
`complete` locally. The repository owner monitors the security inbox. The
sender accepted and retained exactly one authorized synthetic route-test
message with sent status, and recipient-side inspection confirmed receipt at
the approved mailbox. The message landed in the junk folder, so monitoring
filtered folders or maintaining appropriate allowlisting remains required.
Ticket 100 is `in_progress`. They define the public repository security gate,
open-source license and private disclosure contract, and authorized GitHub
publication sequence. Tickets 079-083 and 093 are deployed and verified. The
authorized private `main` history rewrite is complete. Ticket 100 has started
with read-only inventory and safe local release files. It still requires
separate explicit authorization for every repository or production mutation.
The repository remains private.

Tickets 101-103 are `not_started`. They complete the public Trust evidence
pipeline: Ticket 101 defines the versioned evidence and freshness contract,
Ticket 102 publishes post-deployment provenance, dependency, integrity, route,
migration, and RLS evidence, and Ticket 103 renders normalized results on the
public Trust page and machine route. Ticket 102 depends on Tickets 092 and
098-101. Ticket 103 depends on Tickets 100-102.

Four remediated findings remain live in production until their migration or
application deployment is authorized:

- Ticket 079: `profiles.email` is writable by its owner through the Data API
  because the base schema grants table-wide DML, and the reminder processor
  uses that column as the outbound email recipient. An account can direct
  Cadence's transactional email at a third party from the project's sending
  domain. The local migration and acceptance proof are complete. Hosted
  migration deployment remains unauthorized.
- Ticket 080: abandoned reminder claims remain stranded, reminder sends can
  overwrite a mid-flight cancellation, and missing email configuration can
  block browser push. The local application fix and acceptance proof are
  complete. Application deployment remains unauthorized.
- Ticket 082: production still permits unbounded active subscriptions and
  sequential unbounded fan-out, and sign out still leaves the current-device
  row active. The local migration, application fix, and acceptance proof are
  complete. Hosted migration and application deployment remain unauthorized.
- Ticket 083: production still uses sign-out-before-delete ordering and
  non-atomic timezone writes until the configuration-history and Ticket 083
  migrations plus application changes deploy. Hosted migration and application
  deployment remain unauthorized.

The completed sequence includes the Ticket 001 Next.js scaffold, Ticket 002
Supabase Auth setup, Ticket 003 database schema, Tickets 004-012 core behavior
tracking and export, Ticket 013 Vercel deployment, BehaviorLog interoperability
and import/restore work through Ticket 028, public hardening and launch
readiness through Ticket 034, performance work through Ticket 047, UX and trust
work through Ticket 056, history/restore/schedule integrity through Ticket 060,
Ticket 061's export prompt library, and the project-definition and
agent-bootstrap layer.

The current UX backlog pass has completed implementation for Tickets 048-052:
UX research reproduction/triage, Settings baseline correctness, first-run
mobile layout robustness, Timeline daily workflow usability, and Needs Decision
interaction correctness. The pass stayed within the existing Timeline and
Settings surfaces and did not add new routes, dashboards, stored statuses,
provider operations, or out-of-scope product behavior.

Ticket 053 is complete. Browser reminder copy now separates behavior-level
intent from current-device delivery readiness, and service-worker notification
clicks are covered by a regression test that navigates an existing same-origin
Cadence tab to the intended Timeline URL before focusing it.

Ticket 054 is complete. Clear decision is scoped to selected behavior-date
review, and an owner-approved proxy browser walkthrough verified the heatmap
review path at desktop and 390px.

Ticket 055 is complete. Import apply is bound to the exact accepted
merge-preview run and its bundle, local-data, and combined preview fingerprints;
the binding, restore-preview timestamp correction, safety-count disclosure,
fixture-backed browser QA, and final repository-wide verification pass locally.

Ticket 056 is complete. Owner-approved agent-proxy browser walkthroughs found
that the homepage blurred Cadence with BehaviorLog and used ambiguous "open
tracker" language. The revised first viewport now names Cadence as the
open-source personal tracker and BehaviorLog as its portable export file
format. Reruns passed discovery, portability, and pre-login trust tasks. This
is proxy evidence only; real-user testing remains necessary before claiming
externally validated comprehension.

Ticket 057 is complete. Behavior title and description revisions now
have append-only, owner-scoped history with atomic baseline/change writes, and
the history is included in full JSON and BehaviorLog exports. Its migration was
deployed to hosted Supabase on 2026-07-13.

Ticket 058 is complete. Manual status transitions now persist the
occurrence snapshot, append-only event, and resolver-planned reminder
cancellation in one owner-scoped transaction with idempotency and ABA guards.
Its migration was deployed to hosted Supabase on 2026-07-13.

Ticket 059 is complete. Restore apply now binds one exact accepted
preview and canonical payload, verifies stale-row preconditions, and commits
product writes, definition history, provenance, and the applied ledger in one
idempotent transaction. Its migration was deployed to hosted Supabase on
2026-07-13.

Ticket 060 is complete. The idempotent schedule-integrity migration was
deployed to hosted Supabase on 2026-07-17, the affected stale account was
resynced through the protected production route, and the compatible
application was deployed to Vercel production. Privacy-safe SQL proof and an
authenticated browser walkthrough confirmed zero active empty schedules,
owner-consistent schedule slots, exactly-once repaired occurrences, preserved
manual history, Needs decision visibility, current/future Timeline rows, and a
fresh post-sync horizon without past reminder deliveries.

Product posture update: Cadence is now scoped as a public, open-source
single-account personal behavior tracker product. The current implemented
surfaces are the authenticated Next.js web app and a sibling Astro marketing
site under `apps/marketing`; future surfaces are a Tauri desktop app proposal
and a future mobile app. The first public-product implementation steps are
hardening the current web app for many independent Google-auth users and
launching the static marketing surface, not billing, AI, desktop, or mobile
work. The target composable workspace and public marketing scope live in
`docs/PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Current evidence:

- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` exist with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, Vitest, npm workspaces, and marketing workspace scripts.
- `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, and `tests/` application directories exist.
- `apps/marketing` exists as a static Astro app with routes `/`, `/standard`,
  `/cadence`, `/examples`, `/docs`, and `/about`, plus Markdown mirrors,
  `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, a route manifest, sitemap, robots output, and a
  build-generated sanitized example BehaviorLog bundle. It is deployed as the
  separate Vercel project `cadence-marketing` with production alias
  `https://cadence-marketing-two.vercel.app`.
- Primary app routes exist for Timeline, Behaviors, Export, and Settings. `/analytics` remains as a protected compatibility redirect to `/behaviors`. Public account-information routes exist for Terms, Privacy, and Trust. Export is implemented with JSONL, CSV, full JSON backup, BehaviorLog bundle, Markdown AI summary outputs, and BehaviorLog import.
- Supabase SSR auth utilities exist under `lib/supabase/`, with Google login at `/login`, OAuth callback handling at `/auth/callback`, and protected app routes guarded by `proxy.ts` plus the app layout.
- Supabase CLI has been initialized with `supabase/config.toml`; local Supabase uses the 5532x port range to avoid conflicts with another local Supabase stack.
- Product database schema exists in `supabase/migrations/20260607204951_create_database_schema.sql` with RLS-enabled profiles, categories, behaviors, occurrences, reminder_deliveries, and push_subscriptions tables. Ticket 010 adds `supabase/migrations/20260608011000_add_reminder_delivery_processing_claim.sql` for an internal `reminder_deliveries.processing_started_at` claim timestamp.
- Auth user onboarding creates a profile and default categories; migration backfills existing auth users.
- Supabase database types are generated in `lib/db/database.types.ts`, with hand-written domain aliases in `lib/types/database.ts`.
- A pure Temporal-based recurrence resolver exists in `lib/resolvers/recurrence.resolver.ts`, with recurrence domain types in `lib/types/recurrence.ts` and paired tests in `tests/recurrence.resolver.test.ts`.
- Behavior CRUD exists on `/behaviors` with server actions, service/repository access through the authenticated Supabase user, category selection, recurrence editing, scheduled time, browser/email reminder settings, active/archive handling, and active/archived lists.
- Occurrence generation exists in `lib/resolvers/occurrence.resolver.ts`, `lib/services/occurrence.service.ts`, and `lib/db/occurrences.repo.ts`. Behavior create/edit/archive marks the user's occurrence horizon stale, while Timeline, Behaviors review, Export, and the protected occurrence sync route repair the rolling occurrence window before generated occurrences are needed. Sync inserts missing rows idempotently, removes stale future unresolved rows, and preserves past or resolved occurrence history.
- Timeline grouping exists in `lib/resolvers/timeline.resolver.ts`, `lib/services/timeline.service.ts`, and `/timeline`. The page syncs missing occurrences before rendering, surfaces Needs decision for prior unresolved active-behavior occurrences plus same-day retained prior decisions through a floating lower-right button and modal, starts the forward timeline at the current local day, shows the next 7 days by default, and can expand future visibility up to the generated 30-day horizon.
- Status marking and note editing exists in `lib/resolvers/status.resolver.ts`, `lib/services/occurrence.service.ts`, `app/(app)/timeline/actions.ts`, and Timeline row controls. Completed and Not Completed actions update `status_marked_at`; Completed also sets `completed_at`; switching away from Completed clears `completed_at`; note-only edits preserve status timestamps.
- Browser push subscription storage exists at `app/api/push/subscribe/route.ts`, `lib/services/push-subscription.service.ts`, and `lib/db/pushSubscriptions.repo.ts`; subscription registration validates endpoint/key shape, stores active subscriptions through the authenticated Supabase user context, lists active subscriptions for browser-push sends, and marks expired subscriptions inactive.
- Reminder delivery planning exists in `lib/resolvers/reminder.resolver.ts`, `lib/services/reminder.service.ts`, and `lib/db/reminderDeliveries.repo.ts`. Occurrence sync now creates missing pending reminder deliveries idempotently from behavior reminder settings, including browser reminders enabled by default, and status resolution cancels pending deliveries for resolved occurrences.
- Reminder processing code exists at `app/api/reminders/process/route.ts`, `lib/services/reminder.service.ts`, `lib/db/reminderDeliveries.repo.ts`, `lib/services/sequenzy.service.ts`, and `lib/services/web-push.service.ts`. The protected process route validates `REMINDER_PROCESS_SECRET` or `CRON_SECRET`, rate-limits repeated auth failures, bounds manual batch size, claims due pending email and browser-push deliveries with `processing_started_at`, re-checks current occurrence/behavior eligibility through the reminder resolver, sends Sequenzy template emails or VAPID-backed browser push from server-only code, and records sent, failed, or cancelled outcomes. Sequenzy provider setup is verified with transactional slug `habit-reminder`; local `.env.local` has `SEQUENZY_REMINDER_TEMPLATE_SLUG=habit-reminder`.
- Behavior review uses `lib/resolvers/analytics.resolver.ts`, `lib/services/analytics.service.ts`, and `/behaviors`. The resolver owns range normalization, adherence math, status counts, overall and per-behavior heatmap day states, category counts, and behavior date review rows for status/note correction. Default adherence excludes unresolved occurrences, the top summary Unresolved count matches the Timeline Needs decision count, and per-behavior/category detail count grids render only Completed and Not Completed while unresolved remains visible through heatmap and review states.
- Export exists in `lib/resolvers/export.resolver.ts`, `lib/services/export.service.ts`, `/export`, and `/api/export/jsonl`, `/api/export/csv`, `/api/export/json`. The resolver owns range filtering, archived-behavior filtering, JSONL, CSV escaping, full JSON backup shape, and Markdown AI summary adherence math. All-time export includes occurrences through the current local day and excludes generated future rows.
- Settings now shows profile email, timezone detection/manual override, notification permission status, browser push availability, a browser reminder enable/save control, Trust/Privacy/Terms links, and account deletion with export acknowledgement plus typed confirmation. Timezone detection uses browser/OS `Intl` data without geolocation; saving a changed timezone updates the profile, active behavior timezones, and future unresolved occurrences through the existing occurrence sync. The client path uses only `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`; the processing/sending layer uses server-only `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Timeline now shows a dismissible first-run setup pop-up for accounts that have
  not completed required launch setup items. It links into the existing
  Behaviors create form, Settings notification subscription, Settings timezone,
  and optional Export import controls without requesting notification permission
  on page load.
- Privacy-safe structured monitoring events now cover OAuth callback failures,
  push subscription route outcomes, and reminder processor outcomes through
  runtime logs. The sanitizer drops sensitive keys and redacts email-shaped
  values before logging.
- `npm run smoke:rls` runs a many-user Supabase RLS smoke check using
  service-role credentials only for temporary user setup/cleanup and ordinary
  signed-in publishable-key clients for isolation checks.
- A minimal `public/push-service-worker.js` displays received push payloads and opens same-origin app URLs, defaulting to `/timeline`. It does not implement PWA install, route caching, background sync, offline writes, or offline mutation.
- Supabase and Sequenzy CLIs are installed as dev dependencies and exposed through `npm run supabase -- ...` and `npm run sequenzy -- ...`.
- Agent operations docs now include Supabase CLI workflow, Sequenzy CLI workflow, date/time strategy, route map, and deterministic drift checks.
- A local/dev-only design-system bench exists at `/design-system`, backed by
  `design-system.config.json`, `design-system.surfaces.json`,
  `design-system.manifest.json`, `design-system.usage.json`, and
  `npm run design-system:check`. It renders foundations, canonical
  cross-surface component-family mappings, and fixture-backed web-app UI. It
  is not in primary navigation, is disabled in production builds, and keeps
  bench previews separate from product usage scans.
- The v1 feature ticket sequence is complete through Ticket 012. Ticket 013 Vercel production hardening is complete after later browser-push production verification: authenticated production smoke QA passed for Google login, Behavior create/archive, Timeline occurrence generation, status changes, notes, Settings render, Analytics render, Export page/link rendering, production reminder cron execution, browser push subscription, and a safe browser-push send.
- Vercel plugin inspection found existing project `cadence` under team `Emi's projects`, connected to GitHub repo `emixd12/habit-tracking-app` on `main`, with canonical public alias `https://cadence-blush-three.vercel.app`. Production public Supabase config is present, `/login` renders without the missing-config warning, Google OAuth returns to the canonical production domain, and `/api/reminders/process` supports Vercel Cron `GET` with secret protection.
- Project-local design workflow files exist under `.agents/skills/impeccable/` and should be used for UI/design work after the scaffold exists.

## Multi-account Supabase launch readiness sign-off

Status: complete.

Scope:
- Ticket 034 has been added to `docs/TICKETS.md` to close the remaining
  readiness gates before inviting additional public accounts onto the hosted
  web app.
- The ticket covers the restore-apply migration defect, hosted schema
  congruence, hosted many-user RLS smoke QA, hosted Auth/provider/account
  settings, and a minimal production Google sign-in smoke.

Current state:
- The restore-apply readiness defect has been fixed by
  `supabase/migrations/20260625220756_fix_behaviorlog_restore_apply_rpc.sql`.
  The corrective migration replaces the invalid Behavior restore upsert
  conflict target with `on conflict (id)` while preserving authenticated-user
  ownership filtering.
- `supabase/migrations/20260625221334_harden_internal_function_permissions.sql`
  pins `public.set_updated_at()` to `search_path = public` and removes direct
  app-role execute privileges from internal trigger functions.
- Hosted Supabase migrations have been pushed through `20260625221334`.
  Hosted migration history now matches local migration history, and hosted
  schema probes confirmed `occurrence_sync_state` exists, the restore RPC is
  corrected, internal trigger functions are not directly executable by
  `anon` or `authenticated`, and restore apply remains callable only by
  `authenticated`.
- Hosted Supabase advisors passed with `--fail-on error`. Remaining hosted
  warnings are the intentional authenticated restore `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC,
  leaked password protection being disabled in hosted Auth settings, and
  pre-existing RLS init-plan performance warnings on older policies.
- Static RLS registry coverage now also checks that every user-owned public
  table has explicit authenticated Data API grants, matching Supabase's 2026
  default-grants posture. The intentionally append-only
  `occurrence_status_events` table remains limited to `select, insert`.
- Current Supabase docs/changelog were reviewed on 2026-06-25 for Auth redirect
  allow lists, Google OAuth callback handling, RLS/Data API grants, and
  `SECURITY DEFINER` function permissions. The relevant launch-readiness rules
  remain: production OAuth should use an exact callback redirect, exposed public
  tables need both RLS and explicit grants, and privileged functions need
  explicit execute grants/revokes plus pinned `search_path`.
- A read-only hosted recheck on 2026-06-25 confirmed local and hosted migration
  histories match through `20260625221334`, all 50 expected authenticated table
  privileges across user-owned tables are present, `anon` cannot execute the
  restore RPC or internal updated-at trigger function, `authenticated` can
  execute the restore RPC, and `authenticated` cannot directly execute the
  internal updated-at trigger function.
- A non-mutating production HTTP smoke on 2026-06-25 confirmed `/login`
  returns 200, unauthenticated `/timeline` redirects to `/login?next=...`, and
  `/auth/google?next=/timeline` redirects to Supabase Google OAuth with the
  production `/auth/callback` redirect URL.
- Hosted many-user RLS smoke QA passed on 2026-06-25 against the confirmed
  project `qjodzutjxtmtzczbloxa.supabase.co`. The smoke created two temporary
  hosted users, verified six cross-account ownership checks through ordinary
  signed-in publishable-key clients, and cleaned up the temporary users.
- Hosted Auth/provider settings were audited on 2026-06-25 through the
  Supabase Management API without printing secret values. Passing launch
  signals: production Site URL is `https://cadence-blush-three.vercel.app`,
  the production `/auth/callback` URL is allow-listed, Google provider is
  enabled, public signup is enabled, anonymous users are disabled, manual
  identity linking is disabled, phone/SMS auth is disabled, Google nonce checks
  are not skipped, secure email change is enabled, and Auth rate limits are
  configured.
- Hosted Auth audit findings still needing owner decision before broad launch:
  email/password auth remains enabled at the provider level even though the
  product UI exposes Google login only; CAPTCHA/bot protection is disabled;
  leaked-password protection is disabled; localhost callback URLs remain
  allow-listed for development.
- Launch posture decision: first-stage public production launch remains
  Google-login only. Hosted email/password auth is temporarily retained as
  non-user-facing operational/test support while more hosted verification is in
  progress; it should be disabled before broad public account expansion unless
  a later explicit decision changes the product auth posture.
- Launch posture decision: leaked-password protection is not launch-blocking
  once production email/password auth is disabled, because no user password
  flow will remain. CAPTCHA/bot protection is not required for the Google-only
  first-stage launch, but should be revisited before any future email/password,
  passwordless email, OTP, anonymous sign-in, or native Supabase auth surface.
- Production authenticated smoke passed on 2026-06-25 using an existing Chrome
  production session: protected Timeline rendered, profile/default account data
  was present, a temporary smoke behavior was created, Timeline occurrence
  generation showed the new occurrence with Completed/Not Completed controls,
  Export showed JSONL/CSV/full JSON/BehaviorLog download links, Settings showed
  the account deletion export acknowledgement, typed confirmation input, and
  Delete account button, and the temporary smoke behavior was archived.
- A fresh Google OAuth attempt on 2026-06-25 reached the Google account chooser
  with the production callback URL, but the account selection/callback was not
  completed because it requires the user to choose a Google account in Chrome.

Next actions:
- Keep hosted email/password auth enabled only while current hosted testing
  needs it; disable it before broad public account expansion, or record a new
  explicit auth-scope decision.
- Before disabling hosted email/password auth, update or replace hosted smoke
  paths that currently rely on temporary password users.
- Remove localhost callback URLs from the production Supabase project before
  broad public account expansion, or record a time-boxed development exception.
- Finish the fresh production Google OAuth callback by choosing the intended
  Google account in Chrome, then record the sanitized callback result.

## Web App Performance Speed Loop

Status: complete.

Scope:
- Measure production-first and local user-perceived speed for route loads,
  navigation, feature buttons, behavior CRUD, Timeline status/note actions,
  Analytics review, Export downloads, Settings controls, and app-shell
  interactions.
- Implement improvements sequentially, starting with low-risk changes and now
  including scoped performance architecture tickets where evidence shows the
  read-route sync model is the bottleneck. Avoid product-scope expansion,
  offline/PWA mutation support, and unrelated rewrites.
- Keep a before/after measurement record in
  `docs/PERFORMANCE_SPEED_LOG.md`.

Current state:
- Tickets 042-046 are complete as a coordinated performance follow-up.
  Ticket 042 found no Vercel/Supabase region mismatch: production functions are
  in Vercel `iad1`, and the linked Supabase project is in `us-east-1`.
  Ticket 043 added and deployed a narrow authenticated Export-page read RPC.
  Ticket 044 added a per-user read-through cache for stable authenticated data.
  Ticket 045 added Timeline optimistic UI for Completed and Not Completed
  status actions. Ticket 046 changed Behavior create to return a small
  server-confirmed view model and update the current list without revalidating
  `/behaviors`.
- Ticket 047 is complete. `CADENCE_PERF_LOG=1` is now configured in Vercel
  Production, deployment `dpl_GyGQSJX5dCQzyRxA4zXyiEH8K7SN` is `READY`, and
  production Vercel logs now include sanitized `performance_timing` server
  spans for authenticated route loads.
- A 2026-06-30 first-screen transfer pass is complete. Timeline no longer
  preloads `completion-chime.mp3` on initial render; browser measurements show
  52KB less compressed transfer on both desktop and mobile with pixel-identical
  screenshots. Details are recorded in `docs/PERFORMANCE_SPEED_LOG.md`.
- Initial measurement plan, feature test matrix, and intervention backlog have
  been added in `docs/PERFORMANCE_SPEED_LOG.md`.
- Production baseline measurements have been recorded for unauthenticated HTTP,
  authenticated Chrome route loads, authenticated client navigation, Behavior
  create/archive, Timeline status, and Timeline note save behavior.
- First low-risk implementation batch is complete locally: service reads are
  parallelized/reused for Timeline, Analytics, and Export; sync now processes
  independent behaviors in parallel; static brand/sound assets have short
  durable cache headers; Chrome-extension body hydration noise is suppressed;
  completion chime preloading is deduped; Timeline note saves avoid full route
  revalidation.
- A second low-risk sync batch is complete locally: per-behavior generation
  reads existing occurrences and schedule slots in parallel, and reminder
  planning reuses the already-fetched occurrence list when generation made no
  occurrence mutations.
- A third local optimization batch is complete: route-load occurrence sync now
  preserves parallel per-behavior reads while batching stable create/delete and
  reminder delivery writes across behaviors; protected route services reuse a
  request-scoped Supabase Auth user lookup; Timeline now shares behavior and
  timezone reads between the feed and first-run setup state.
- Local production-build after-change route measurements have been recorded.
  Production after-change measurements are now recorded in
  `docs/PERFORMANCE_SPEED_LOG.md`.
- Ticket 035 performance server timing instrumentation is complete locally.
  `CADENCE_PERF_LOG=1` now enables privacy-safe JSON timing spans for protected
  app layout auth, route data loads, occurrence sync phases, reminder
  planning/writes, and primary repository reads used by Timeline, Behaviors,
  Analytics, and Export. `npm run perf:routes` provides a repeatable local or
  production HTTP route timing harness without printing cookies or response
  bodies.
- Ticket 035 authenticated local production-build measurement is recorded in
  `docs/PERFORMANCE_SPEED_LOG.md`. The first span sample shows read-route
  occurrence sync and reminder planning remain the dominant costs; no speed
  improvement was attempted in this evidence-only ticket.
- Ticket 036 route loading/navigation response is complete locally. A shared
  authenticated app loading boundary now covers Timeline, Behaviors,
  Analytics, Export, and Settings, and the app shell marks clicked primary nav
  links as pending without changing Next `Link` prefetch behavior. Local
  production-build browser QA covered desktop `1280x900` and mobile `390x844`
  route checks with no horizontal overflow or browser console warnings.
- Ticket 037 occurrence sync freshness state is complete locally. A new
  RLS-protected `occurrence_sync_state` table records each user's sync
  timezone/horizon, stale reason, last successful sync timestamp, and aggregate
  counts. Repository/service helpers read state, mark it stale, mark it fresh
  after successful account sync, and decide if a requested local-date horizon is
  covered. Behavior create/edit/archive/restore, Settings timezone save, and
  BehaviorLog import/restore apply paths now update the freshness contract
  without removing read-route occurrence sync yet. The hosted Supabase project
  now has the Ticket 037 migration after the authorized 2026-06-25 `db push`.
- Ticket 038 occurrence sync removal from hot read routes is complete locally.
  Timeline, Analytics, and Export now use freshness-aware occurrence sync
  checks instead of unconditional full sync. The occurrence planner no longer
  lets smaller read-route horizons delete unresolved rows beyond the requested
  window. A new protected `/api/occurrences/sync` route and daily Vercel Cron
  entry keep account horizons extendable in the background. Behavior
  create/edit/archive/restore now mark the horizon stale and defer the heavy
  sync to the next freshness-aware read or background sync process; Settings
  timezone save still performs immediate sync because the timezone contract
  requires updating active behavior schedules and future unresolved occurrences
  together. Local stack timing with
  `CADENCE_PERF_LOG=1` confirmed covered read routes emit
  `service.ensure_user_occurrences_fresh` with `covered=1` and `synced=0`.
- The hosted schema blocker for Ticket 038 production timing is resolved:
  hosted Supabase migration history now matches local through
  `20260625221334`, including `occurrence_sync_state`. Hosted production timing
  has now been measured against the current production deployment.
- Ticket 039 reminder planning decoupling is complete locally. Occurrence
  freshness repair during Timeline, Analytics, and Export page reads now
  suppresses reminder-delivery planning writes, while behavior/timezone/import/
  restore write paths and the protected occurrence horizon sync process still
  plan or cancel reminder deliveries. `docs/NOTIFICATION_SPEC.md` documents
  that reminder delivery planning belongs on write/background paths, not route
  rendering.
- Ticket 040 auth/app-shell latency reduction is complete locally. The
  protected proxy now uses Supabase Auth `getClaims()` for route gating and
  login/root redirects, with a `proxy.auth.get_claims` timing span. The
  authenticated app layout still uses `getUser()` for account display name and
  email, and settings/account paths that need authoritative user details remain
  unchanged. Local stack smoke confirmed unauthenticated protected-route
  redirect, anonymous `/login`, authenticated `/settings`, authenticated
  `/login?next=/settings` redirect, and browser-rendered `/timeline`,
  `/behaviors`, and `/settings`.
- Ticket 041 query evidence review is complete locally with no schema change.
  A local production-build route matrix after Tickets 038-040 showed primary
  routes in roughly 22-56ms through authenticated curl, and warm occurrence
  repository spans in the low single-digit milliseconds. Existing indexes cover
  the measured Timeline, Analytics, Export, and reminder due-delivery query
  shapes. No Supabase migration, generated type update, or Timeline read RPC was
  added because the evidence does not show an index/RPC bottleneck.
- Ticket 041 production-side validation is complete. Vercel production
  deployment `dpl_3XUkDXzhPi2M7oexyJWGAvuRn4md` is `READY`, points at commit
  `8ed1b3b734814d2fcd6725a252a8972f6160b6c5`, and built successfully in
  `iad1`.
- Authenticated production route medians improved materially for the previously
  slow routes compared with the baseline: Timeline `833ms` versus `2272ms`,
  Analytics `850ms` versus `2263ms`, and Export `967ms` versus `1642ms`.
  Behaviors improved to `637ms`; Settings stayed roughly similar at `644ms`.
- Authenticated production navigation is now around `0.8-1.1s` across the
  primary app routes in the measured pass. Timeline -> Behaviors is essentially
  unchanged from baseline, while Behaviors -> Analytics, Analytics -> Export,
  and Settings -> Timeline improved substantially.
- Production static asset cache headers are active for the raw logo and
  completion chime assets, returning
  `public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=604800` and Vercel cache hits
  during the header check.
- Mobile production sanity at `390x844` rendered Timeline, Behaviors,
  Analytics, Export, and Settings with no document-level horizontal overflow.
  A clean mobile-first production tab had no warning or error console entries.
- No index, RPC, cache, offline, or UI-scope expansion is justified by the
  production validation evidence. Future performance ideas remain future-only
  until a later hosted or seeded high-cardinality timing pass identifies a
  specific bottleneck.
- A 2026-06-26 follow-up speed pass is complete locally. It switched ordinary
  authenticated app user-id reads from full Supabase Auth `getUser()` calls to
  verified claims, preloads occurrence freshness state into Timeline,
  Analytics, and Export, streams protected route content behind immediate page
  shells, reuses one BehaviorLog import-run query for both Export import and
  restore panels, removes redundant occurrence reads from note/status actions,
  and moves behavior CRUD off eager occurrence/reminder sync.
- Final local production-build authenticated route matrix after the follow-up,
  using the same cookie harness and a populated temporary test account, showed
  median TTFB under 15ms for every app page: Timeline `12.5ms`, Behaviors
  `10.8ms`, Analytics `7.7ms`, Export `11.3ms`, Settings `8.7ms`. Full HTML
  stream medians were Timeline `386.8ms`, Behaviors `188.3ms`, Analytics
  `366.8ms`, Export `588.4ms`, Settings `179.8ms`.
- Create-behavior action timing on the same local production build improved
  from `2446ms` before behavior-action changes to `715ms` after deferring
  occurrence sync, removing the category/profile pre-reads from create, using
  insert-only schedule-slot creation, and avoiding the heavy joined behavior
  insert result. It remains above the requested 100ms because a normal Next
  form action still performs hosted database writes and re-renders the
  Behaviors page.
- The strict "every full page and action under 100ms" target was not reached
  under the repeatable local-to-hosted-Supabase conditions. Warm server auth
  and shell TTFB are now under 100ms; full authenticated data streams and
  mutation actions are bounded by one or more hosted Supabase round trips
  measured around 155-200ms from this machine, plus required post-action
  re-render work.

## Design-system surface catalog update

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added `design-system.surfaces.json` as the canonical cross-surface design
  catalog for the authenticated web app, Astro marketing site, future desktop
  app, and future mobile app.
- The catalog defines shared component-family contracts for foundations,
  text actions, form controls, navigation, surface shells, disclosure sections,
  Timeline feed, Needs decision, Analytics calendar, Behavior editor,
  Export/portability, and brand marks.
- Updated `/design-system` so the bench now shows surface cards and a canonical
  component-family matrix before the existing web-app trace cards. Web-app
  entries link back to live manifest trace anchors; Astro and future-surface
  entries point to native source files or planned implementation docs.
- Extended `npm run design-system:check` to validate the surface catalog for
  duplicate ids, missing sources, unknown surfaces, and unknown web manifest
  component references.
- Updated `docs/PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, and
  `DESIGN.md` to document one canonical design system with surface-scoped
  implementations.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run test` (41 files, 257 tests)
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Pass: `git diff --check`
- HTTP QA: existing Next dev server at `http://localhost:3000/design-system`
  returned 200 and rendered Surfaces, Canonical component families,
  Authenticated web app, Astro marketing site, and Timeline feed content.

Remaining risk:
- The global bench shows Astro and future desktop/mobile mappings, but only the
  authenticated web app has a strict live manifest today. Add native manifests
  or surface-specific benches when those surfaces have enough live UI to verify.

## Marketing Cadence positioning update

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Repositioned the Astro marketing site around Cadence as the site brand,
  homepage lead, and public product name. BehaviorLog now reads as the open
  bundle standard and portability layer behind Cadence exports and imports.
- Updated the marketing header to use only the Cadence logo and name, launch
  route links for `Cadence` and `BehaviorLog`, and a persistent `Log in`
  action to the authenticated app. The footer keeps project links including
  `About`.
- Expanded marketing copy on the homepage, Cadence page, BehaviorLog page,
  Docs page, and About page. The Docs page now includes a quick-start contract
  and a future developer-docs structure for Guides, Reference, Examples, Agent
  policy, and Schema history.
- Applied the existing square ledger design primitives to the marketing header,
  CTA treatment, hero sizing, favicon, and docs tables. Mobile docs tables now
  scroll inside their own containers without document-level horizontal
  overflow.
- Updated source-of-truth docs and the cross-surface design catalog so future
  work does not restore the older BehaviorLog-led homepage posture.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run marketing:build`
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check`
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test` (41 files, 257 tests)
- Pass: `npm run build`

Browser QA:
- Astro preview served at `http://localhost:4322/` because port `4321` was in
  use.
- Chrome/Playwright checks passed for `/`, `/cadence`, `/standard`, `/docs`,
  `/examples`, and `/about` at 1280x900 and 390x844.
- Verified 200 responses, no console warnings/errors, Cadence-only header
  brand with one logo image, `BehaviorLog` nav label, visible `Log in` action,
  no document-level horizontal overflow, and internally scrollable docs/example
  tables on mobile.
- Focused homepage QA verified that the hero capture does not overlap headline
  or body copy and that the next section is visible in the first 1280x900
  viewport.

Remaining risk:
- `/docs` is still a compact static entry point. The full developer-docs
  structure is scoped as future documentation work, now recorded in the site
  copy and source docs.

## Timeline UI feedback update

- Reworked first-run setup on `/timeline` from an inline feed band into a
  dismissible fixed pop-up so the current-day feed remains first in document
  flow.
- Updated Timeline resolver metadata so `not_completed` rows now match
  Completed row structure: compact resolved row, collapsed status label, and
  correction controls only after expanding.
- Cleaned up the Needs decision modal by removing the repeated Prior
  unresolved label, using white date groups, and showing each date's remaining
  unresolved count under the date label.

Verification for this update: Pass: `npx vitest run tests/timeline.resolver.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`; Pass: `npm run design-system:check`; Pass: `git diff --check`.

Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` desktop render showed the
first-run setup as a fixed dismissible pop-up with no horizontal overflow. The
Needs decision modal no longer repeated Prior unresolved in the header, date
groups used a white background with `0 left to decide` under the date, and Not
Completed rows matched Completed row structure with a collapsed label and no
visible collapsed action buttons.

Browser QA: `/timeline` at 390px width showed no horizontal overflow; the fixed
Needs decision button stayed within the safe-area width; the modal was
full-height; and Completed and Not Completed retained rows had matching row
heights, labels, and no visible collapsed action buttons. Browser logs showed
no warnings or errors.

Follow-up modal header refinement:
- Removed the visible global Needs decision title and total-to-decide label
  from the open modal header while keeping the close control and accessible
  dialog label.
- Updated `DESIGN.md`, `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, and `docs/USER_FLOWS.md` so the open
  modal is led by date groups only.
- Verification: Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run
  resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass:
  `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run design-system:check`; Pass: `npm run build`;
  Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Browser QA: design-system Needs decision dialog preview at 1127px and 390px
  opened with an empty visible header, exactly one close button, no visible
  heading or paragraph in the header, date-group text first, and no horizontal
  overflow.

Follow-up modal top-space refinement:
- Removed the remaining reserved header row from the open Needs decision modal.
  The close control is now pinned over the top-right corner, and the first date
  group starts at the top of the scroll area with right padding reserved for the
  close control.
- Updated `DESIGN.md`, `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, and `docs/USER_FLOWS.md` to specify
  the overlaid close control and no reserved header row.
- Verification: Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run
  resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass:
  `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run design-system:check`; Pass: `npm run build`;
  Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Browser QA: design-system Needs decision dialog preview at 1127px and 390px
  opened with no modal header element, the close button pinned top-right, the
  first date group at the top of the scroll area, and no horizontal overflow.

Follow-up modal gutter refinement:
- Removed the asymmetric right padding from the Needs decision modal scroll
  area so date groups and occurrence rows stretch to matching left and right
  gutters. The date header text row alone reserves space for the overlaid close
  control.
- Updated `DESIGN.md`, `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, and `docs/USER_FLOWS.md` to document
  equal modal gutters with a close-control text guard.
- Verification: Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run
  resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass:
  `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run design-system:check`; Pass: `npm run build`;
  Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Browser QA: design-system Needs decision dialog preview at 1032px, 1127px,
  and 390px showed equal left/right distances from the modal to the date group
  and first occurrence row, a pinned top-right close button, no modal header
  element, and no horizontal overflow.

## Agent operations update

This governance update added CLI-first Supabase and Sequenzy workflows, route/date-time/resolver registry docs, project-local CLI scripts, and deterministic drift checks.

Verification run for this update:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test`
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- --version` returned `2.105.0`
- Pass: `npm run sequenzy -- --version` returned `0.0.34`
- Pass: `npm audit --omit=dev` found 0 vulnerabilities

Supabase is initialized for local development. Ticket 003 added the first product database migration and generated database types.

## Ticket status

| Ticket | Status | Implementation summary | Verification | Blockers / next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001: Initialize app | complete | Added Next.js App Router TypeScript scaffold with Tailwind v4, ESLint, Vitest, a responsive app shell, `/timeline`, `/behaviors`, `/analytics`, `/export`, and `/settings` placeholder routes, and a navigation smoke test. No database, auth, schema, or product feature logic added. | Pass: `npm run lint`; `npm run typecheck`; `npm run test`; `npm run build`; browser QA at desktop width and 390px mobile viewport; `npm audit --omit=dev` found 0 vulnerabilities. | Start Ticket 002: Add Supabase Auth. |
| 002: Add Supabase Auth | complete | Added `@supabase/ssr` and `@supabase/supabase-js`; created browser/server Supabase clients; initialized `supabase/config.toml`; added Google login at `/login`, OAuth callback exchange at `/auth/callback`, Next 16 `proxy.ts` session refresh/redirect handling, server-side app layout auth guard, sanitized auth redirect helpers, env docs, and auth redirect tests. No service-role key is used in browser code. | Pass: `npm run agents:check`; `npm run resolvers:check`; `npm run lint`; `npm run typecheck`; `npm run test`; `npm run build`; HTTP QA for `/`, `/timeline`, `/login`, and `/auth/callback`; browser QA for `/login` at desktop and 390px mobile plus protected `/timeline` redirect. | Start Ticket 003: Create database schema. Google OAuth still requires real Supabase project/provider credentials in local/deployed environment. |
| 003: Create database schema | complete | Added initial Supabase schema migration for profiles, categories, behaviors, occurrences, reminder_deliveries, and push_subscriptions; enabled owner-scoped RLS policies; added updated_at triggers, relationship ownership constraints, reminder/subscription idempotence constraints, auth-user profile/default-category onboarding, existing-user backfill, empty local seed placeholder, generated Supabase database types, and domain aliases for status/channel literals. Clarified that `profiles.id` is the profile ownership key instead of a separate `user_id`. Local Supabase ports moved to 5532x to avoid an existing local stack conflict. | Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`; Pass: SQL smoke check for default categories, profile/category RLS, cross-user insert rejection, and cross-user category-link rejection; Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`. | Start Ticket 004: Recurrence resolver. Hosted Supabase deployment still requires explicit user authorization before `npm run supabase -- db push`. |
| 004: Recurrence resolver | complete | Added `@js-temporal/polyfill`, recurrence rule/domain types, and a pure Temporal-based `resolveOccurrenceSchedule` resolver covering daily, every-N-days, weekly, every-N-weeks, monthly day-N with last-day fallback, local scheduled times, explicit timezones, optional local anchor dates for interval phase, and DST disambiguation. Updated `docs/RECURRENCE_RULES.md` so the resolver contract matches the locked Temporal strategy. | Pass: `npx vitest run tests/recurrence.resolver.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`. | Start Ticket 005: Behavior CRUD. Future occurrence services should pass a stable local anchor date, such as behavior created/start date, for interval-based rules. |
| 005: Behavior CRUD | complete | Added behavior repository/service/server actions; implemented `/behaviors` create/edit/archive UI with category selection, recurrence editor, scheduled time, browser/email reminder settings, active toggle, active/archived sections, and preserved-history archive semantics via `active=false` plus `archived_at`. Updated `DESIGN.md` from the implemented behavior form/card patterns. Authenticated QA found and fixed client-side Supabase public env loading, callback provider-error handling, and edit-form stale defaults after successful saves. Hosted migration `20260607204951_create_database_schema.sql` was pushed after user authorization. | Pass: `npx vitest run tests/behavior-form.test.ts`; Pass: `npx vitest run tests/supabase-env.test.ts tests/auth-redirects.test.ts tests/auth-callback-route.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes`; Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list --linked`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`; Browser QA: hosted Google OAuth from `http://localhost:3000` completed and redirected to `/behaviors`; authenticated create/edit/archive flow passed against hosted Supabase; active behavior moved to Archived with preserved history; 390px mobile viewport had no horizontal overflow. | Start Ticket 006: Occurrence generation. Local Supabase OAuth still needs its Google redirect URI updated if local Google OAuth is used. |
| 006: Occurrence generation | complete | Added pure occurrence generation planning for the rolling today + 30 day local-date window; added Supabase occurrence repository/service orchestration; wired behavior create/edit/archive to sync occurrences; idempotent inserts use `behavior_id, scheduled_for`; stale future unresolved rows are removed while past and resolved rows are preserved. Widened the recurrence resolver range input to accept `Temporal.Instant` as well as `Date`. | Pass: `npx vitest run tests/occurrence.resolver.test.ts tests/recurrence.resolver.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`. | Ticket 007 complete; start Ticket 008: Status marking and notes. |
| 007: Timeline | complete | Added pure Timeline grouping resolver and tests; added timeline service and occurrence repository reads; replaced `/timeline` placeholder with Needs decision, current day, future day sections, show-more control, empty-day states, resolved-state styling, and expandable occurrence details. Status mutation and note editing remain for Ticket 008. Updated `DESIGN.md` from the implemented Timeline UI. | Pass: `npx vitest run tests/timeline.resolver.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`; Browser QA: `/timeline` authenticated render at 1280px and 390px, no horizontal overflow, Needs decision/current/future empty states visible, show-more control visible on mobile. | Start Ticket 008: Status marking and notes. |
| 008: Status marking and notes | complete | Added pure status transition and note normalization resolver; added occurrence repository/service update path; added Timeline server actions; replaced disabled Timeline buttons with live Completed / Not Completed controls; added inline expanded note editing; resolved rows can change status later from expanded details. | Pass: `npx vitest run tests/status.resolver.test.ts tests/timeline.resolver.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`; Browser QA: in-app browser `/timeline` redirected unauthenticated session to `/login` with no console errors. Authenticated Timeline visual QA was not possible because the in-app browser did not have a Supabase session, and Chrome fallback was not used without explicit approval. | Start Ticket 009: Browser push. Reminder cancellation on status resolution remains for the reminder-service tickets, where deliveries are generated and processed. |
| 009: Browser push | complete | Added reminder delivery resolver/tests; created reminder delivery repository/service and wired occurrence sync to create missing browser/email delivery rows from behavior reminder settings; resolving an occurrence cancels pending deliveries. Added authenticated push subscription API route, service validation, and repository upsert. Replaced Settings placeholder with profile, timezone, notification permission, and browser push availability panels plus a client enable/save control. Added minimal push service worker display/click handling without offline/PWA caching. Updated `DESIGN.md` from the implemented Settings UI and `docs/ROUTE_MAP.md` for the implemented Settings/API route state. No schema migration was needed because `push_subscriptions` and `reminder_deliveries` already existed. | Pass: `npx vitest run tests/reminder.resolver.test.ts tests/push-subscribe-route.test.ts tests/push-browser.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`; Browser QA: in-app browser `/settings` authenticated render at 1280px and 390px, no horizontal overflow, no console errors. Local degraded-state QA showed permission `Blocked` and missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, so the real browser permission prompt/subscription handshake was not clicked in this environment. | Start Ticket 010: Email reminders. Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` for real browser subscription testing; keep VAPID private/server keys out of browser code. |
| 010: Email reminders | complete | Added a `processing_started_at` claim migration and regenerated Supabase types; extended the existing reminder repository/service to list, claim, cancel, mark sent, and mark failed due email deliveries; added a server-only Sequenzy transactional template adapter; added protected `POST /api/reminders/process`; stale pending email deliveries are cancelled when the behavior is inactive, email reminders are disabled, the occurrence is resolved, or the current resolver-planned offset no longer matches. Runtime uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `REMINDER_PROCESS_SECRET`, `SEQUENZY_API_KEY`, and `SEQUENZY_REMINDER_TEMPLATE_SLUG` only on the server side. Provider setup uses transactional slug `habit-reminder`, and local `.env.local` sets `SEQUENZY_REMINDER_TEMPLATE_SLUG=habit-reminder`. Hosted Supabase migration `20260608011000_add_reminder_delivery_processing_claim.sql` has been pushed. | Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`; Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts`; Pass: `npm run test -- tests/reminder.resolver.test.ts tests/reminder.service.test.ts tests/reminder-process-route.test.ts tests/sequenzy.service.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`; Pass: `npm run sequenzy -- whoami` with `.env.local` loaded; Pass: `npm run sequenzy -- transactional get habit-reminder --json`; Pass: one user-approved historical test send to a recipient now redacted from the working tree (the address remains in Git history); Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes`; Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list --linked` shows local and remote `20260608011000`. | Start Ticket 011: Analytics. Set `REMINDER_PROCESS_SECRET` in the deployed/server runtime before scheduling calls to `/api/reminders/process`; do not expose it to the browser. |
| 011: Analytics | complete | Added pure analytics resolver/types/tests; added analytics service orchestration over existing behavior and occurrence repositories; replaced `/analytics` with a sparse server-rendered screen containing overall adherence, 7/30/90 range links, an overall calendar heatmap, selected-day Not Completed inspection, per-behavior counts and heatmaps, and compact category counts. Updated `docs/ROUTE_MAP.md` and `DESIGN.md` from the implemented screen. | Pass: `npx vitest run tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`; Browser QA: in-app browser `/analytics` redirected unauthenticated session to `/login?next=%2Fanalytics` at 1280px and 390px with no horizontal overflow and no console errors. Authenticated Analytics visual QA was not possible because the in-app browser did not have a Supabase session. | Start Ticket 012: Export. No Ticket 011 blockers. |
| 012: Export | complete | Added pure export resolver/types/tests; added export service orchestration over categories, behaviors, occurrences, and profile timezone; added `/api/export/jsonl`, `/api/export/csv`, and `/api/export/json` download routes; replaced `/export` placeholder with range options, Include archived behaviors, download actions, and Markdown AI summary copy/download controls. JSONL emits category, behavior, and occurrence records one per line; CSV uses the documented occurrence columns with escaping; full JSON backup includes `exported_at`, profile timezone, categories, behaviors, and occurrences; Markdown adherence excludes unresolved occurrences. Updated `docs/ROUTE_MAP.md` and `DESIGN.md` from the implemented screen. | Pass: `npx vitest run tests/export.resolver.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`; Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/export` rendered at 1280px and 390px with no horizontal overflow, no console warnings/errors, expected download links, and all-time plus archived query option state preserved. | No Ticket 012 blockers. Future restore/import history remains out of scope unless product docs change. |
| 013: Vercel production deployment | complete | Added `vercel.json` with hourly Vercel Cron for `/api/reminders/process`; updated the route to support Vercel Cron `GET` plus existing protected manual `POST`; added `CRON_SECRET` support alongside `REMINDER_PROCESS_SECRET`; documented Vercel workflow, env ownership, Supabase Auth redirects, smoke QA, and rollback path. Later browser-push troubleshooting and production verification completed the original push-subscription/send blocker. | Pass: `npm run test -- tests/reminder-process-route.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test`; Pass: `npm run build`; production smoke for login/protected redirects/authenticated app routes; production cron logs returned 200; Chrome verified notification permission plus active FCM PushSubscription; safe production browser-push send returned `{ checked: 1, claimed: 1, sent: 1, failed: 0, cancelled: 0 }`. | No Ticket 013 blocker remains. Chrome will not show the native notification permission prompt again for an origin that is already granted or denied unless site settings are reset. Actual file download events remain limited by browser automation, but Export page/link rendering was verified. |

Later ticket rollup:

| Ticket | Status | Current note |
|---|---|---|
| 014: BehaviorLog import validation dry-run | complete | Service/resolver dry-run validation exists; no import writes were added in this ticket. |
| 015: BehaviorLog core conformance harness | complete | Cadence-generated BehaviorLog bundles pass the pinned upstream Level 1 validator snapshot; future changes should update the snapshot intentionally. |
| 016: BehaviorLog Level 2 CSV views | complete | Optional BehaviorLog CSV views are emitted from authoritative JSONL and covered by resolver/conformance tests. |
| 017: BehaviorLog Intervention Profile export | complete | Reminder deliveries export as optional Intervention Profile records without provider side effects or message-body export. |
| 018: BehaviorLog import persistence foundation | complete | Import-run and mapping tables exist with RLS and hosted migration applied. |
| 019: BehaviorLog create-only core import | complete | Create-missing-only behavior/schedule/occurrence/status-event import path exists and remains non-destructive. |
| 020: BehaviorLog conflict-aware merge preview | complete | Merge preview produces deterministic actions/conflicts without mutating product data. |
| 021: BehaviorLog user-approved merge write | complete | Approved merge writes create/map records and append status events without blind overwrite or destructive restore. |
| 022: BehaviorLog optional notes import | complete | Occurrence-attached note import was implemented and later expanded by Ticket 026. |
| 023: BehaviorLog Intervention Profile import preview | complete | Optional intervention import preview was implemented and later expanded by Ticket 027. |
| 024: User-facing BehaviorLog import UI | complete | Export screen includes upload, preview, recent-run, create-only, and approved-merge UI. |
| 025A: BehaviorLog restore preview | complete | Added a preview-only restore resolver/service contract with create/replace/archive/delete/keep/skip action classification, destructive-action flags, non-restorable account/provider/browser fields, status-history policy planning, sensitivity/redaction summaries, stable local/bundle/preview fingerprints, a `restore_preview` import-run mode migration, and focused tests. No product records, reminder deliveries, provider calls, or destructive apply behavior were added. Hosted migration `20260619090000_add_behaviorlog_restore_preview_mode.sql` has been pushed. | Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-restore.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-restore.service.test.ts`; Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`; Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts` (no generated type diff); Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test` (37 files, 247 tests); Pass: `npm run build`; Pass: `git diff --check`; later hosted push/migration-list verification recorded in the Web App Performance Speed Loop ledger. | None for hosted preview schema. |
| 025B: BehaviorLog restore apply and UI | complete | Added a destructive restore apply path behind accepted restore preview/fingerprint checks, typed `RESTORE` confirmation, fresh-backup acknowledgement, sensitivity acknowledgement when relevant, stale-preview refusal, a transaction-scoped Supabase RPC, and sparse Export-screen restore UI. Restore apply is limited to user-owned BehaviorLog product data and does not call Sequenzy, Web Push, browser APIs, provider SDKs, or notification-processing routes. Hosted migration `20260619093000_add_behaviorlog_restore_apply_mode_and_rpc.sql` has been pushed, followed by corrective migration `20260625220756_fix_behaviorlog_restore_apply_rpc.sql` and internal function hardening migration `20260625221334_harden_internal_function_permissions.sql`. | Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-restore-ui.test.tsx tests/behaviorlog-restore-apply.service.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-restore.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-restore.service.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-ui.test.tsx`; Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`; Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts`; Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test` (39 files, 251 tests); Pass: `npm run build`; Pass: `npm run design-system:check`; Pass: `git diff --check`; Browser QA on `/design-system#ds-module-behavior-log-restore-panel` at 1280px and 390px with no horizontal overflow or console warnings/errors; later hosted schema probes verified the restore RPC conflict target and execute permissions. | Destructive restore was not applied against a real account during QA. Current apply expects Cadence/UUID core identifiers for core restore rows and does not recreate categories from BehaviorLog bundles. |
| 026: General BehaviorLog notes data model and import | complete | Passive imported notes table and import/apply support are implemented with sensitivity acknowledgement. |
| 027: Imported intervention history storage | complete | Passive imported intervention history storage exists with RLS and hosted migration applied. |
| 028: Promote imported interventions into reminder deliveries | complete | Service-level promotion path exists with explicit selection/confirmation; no user-facing promotion UI has been added. |

## Post-ticket refinements

### Desktop rail expansion navigation fix (2026-07-28)

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Reproduced the recorded request: the collapsed desktop brand cell expanded
  the rail and navigated to Timeline as one combined interaction.
- Split the header behavior by rail state. Expanded mode keeps the Cadence
  brand link to Timeline and the separate Collapse navigation button.
  Collapsed mode now renders an Expand navigation button with no `href` and no
  navigation side effect.
- Preserved the 64px target, persisted `sidebar-open` preference, Cadence-mark
  to open-sidebar-icon hover treatment, width transition, primary route icons,
  mobile navigation, and expanded brand navigation.
- Updated `components/layout/AppShell.tsx`, the focused shell and registry-label
  tests, `interaction-registry.json`, the design-system preview/catalog,
  `DESIGN.md`, `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and the task-based app
  navigation guide.
- No route, schema, resolver, provider, authentication, or product-data
  behavior changed.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/sign-out-shell.test.tsx tests/interaction-registry-labels.test.ts`
  (2 files, 10 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (106 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run interactions:check` (4299 invariants, 85 interactions, 34
  interaction sources).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (159 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (87 files, 564 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Browser QA: the live AppShell design-system preview exposed one Collapse
  navigation control while expanded and one Expand navigation control while
  collapsed. Expanding restored the separate Open Timeline brand link without
  changing the current URL. No browser warnings or errors appeared.
- Pass: isolated clean-tree verification for production commit
  `c8c92b3bcd18522eaa1e2d5859a3b3469f5c34d7`: agent, interaction, resolver,
  design-system, focused shell, lint, typecheck, full test (81 files, 542
  tests), and production build checks.
- Pass: Vercel production deployment
  `dpl_DLJRWazbUqznKhXyC8F2ZSK2qVCV` reached `READY` and assigned the canonical
  `https://cadence-blush-three.vercel.app` alias.
- Pass: authenticated production browser QA at `/export`. Expanding the
  collapsed rail kept the URL on `/export`, restored the separate Open Timeline
  link to `/timeline`, and exposed the Collapse navigation control. Vercel
  reported no `/export` runtime errors in the selected post-deploy window.

Remaining risk:
- No sidebar deployment blocker remains. The production build completed with
  an existing Ink/React peer-dependency warning; it did not prevent the build
  or the authenticated live smoke.

### Hosted July schema deployment and occurrence-status recovery (2026-07-13)

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Diagnosed production occurrence status failures as application/schema drift:
  Vercel was running the RPC-based Ticket 058 code while hosted Supabase still
  lacked `apply_occurrence_status_transition`.
- Applied the four already-reviewed pending migrations in timestamp order:
  accepted import-preview binding, behavior definition history, transactional
  occurrence status changes, and atomic/idempotent BehaviorLog restore apply.
- Restored hosted schema compatibility for occurrence status changes, behavior
  create/edit, accepted import apply, and restore apply without changing
  product scope or manually editing hosted product rows outside migrations.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --dry-run` listed exactly the four
  expected July migrations.
- Pass: authorized `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes` applied
  migrations through
  `20260709203154_make_behaviorlog_restore_atomic_and_idempotent.sql`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list --linked` confirmed local/hosted
  parity through `20260709203154`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db advisors --linked --type all --fail-on error`
  returned no error-level findings. Warnings remain for the intentional
  authenticated restore wrappers, leaked-password protection, and pre-existing
  RLS initialization-plan performance findings.
- Pass: focused status, behavior-definition, and restore migration/repository
  tests (7 files, 63 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (95 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (152 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (67 files, 429 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Blocked environment check: `npm run smoke:rls` could not reach Supabase from
  the sandbox, and the requested escalated retry was rejected before execution;
  no temporary users were created by that retry.

Remaining risk:
- A real authenticated production status click was not performed during this
  deployment task to avoid adding synthetic status history to a personal
  account. Retry the affected Timeline action as the final user-path smoke.
- The repository should add a production migration-parity preflight so a
  schema-dependent application deployment cannot become ready while matching
  hosted migrations are pending.

### Behaviors browser-comment alignment follow-up (2026-07-12)

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Widened the desktop Overall adherence summary column so the label and short
  percentage stay on one adjacent line, while long empty-state text can wrap as
  a complete metric without colliding with the calendar.
- Right-aligned the range-selector, overall heatmap, and legend cluster against
  the content edge.
- Matched visible per-behavior outcome stats to the Details and Settings
  metadata rhythm at a 4px row gap and 20px line height.
- Raised Add schedule so it sits 8px below the schedule rows.
- Preserved conditional recurrence controls: Daily does not show weekday
  choices, while Weekly shows all seven borderless native checkboxes. Added a
  static-render regression test for both states.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md` and `DESIGN.md` to replace the stale opposite-side
  adherence-percentage rule with the adjacent header and right-aligned calendar
  direction.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (95 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (152 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behavior-review-ui.test.tsx` (4 tests).
- Pass: isolated rerun of `tests/behavior-actions.test.ts` after its initial
  concurrent full-suite run hit the existing 5-second timeout.
- Pass: standalone `npm run test` (67 files, 429 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Browser QA: authenticated local `/behaviors` at 1024x768 confirmed one-line
  adherence label/percentage layout, a 12px label/percentage gap, 0px
  visualization right inset, seven Weekly checkbox controls, an 8px
  schedule-row/Add schedule gap, no horizontal overflow, and no browser errors.
- Browser QA: fixture-backed active behavior data confirmed visible and hidden
  detail lists both use a 4px row gap and 20px line height. Authenticated local
  `/behaviors` at 390x844 and `/timeline` at 1280x720 also rendered without
  horizontal overflow, error overlays, or warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- The refinement is verified locally but has not been deployed to hosted
  production yet.

### Behaviors browser-comment spacing refinement (2026-07-12)

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Tightened the Overall adherence label-to-percentage gap and narrowed the
  visualization column so the range selector, heatmap, and legend sit farther
  right at desktop widths while preserving the stacked mobile order.
- Reduced the behavior-row bottom padding and disclosure trigger height so
  Details and Settings sits closer to the stats/calendar without taking the
  expanding underline out of document flow.
- Removed the expanded-details top padding, reduced metadata row spacing and
  line height, and kept the editor separated from the compact metadata block.
- Replaced the bordered weekday checkbox chips with compact borderless labels
  around the existing native checkboxes, and updated `DESIGN.md` to make that
  intentional product direction explicit.
- Removed the overlapping-occurrences helper sentence from the form. Resolver
  deduplication behavior and coverage remain unchanged.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (95 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (152 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (67 files, 428 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Browser QA: authenticated local `/behaviors` at 1024x768 confirmed a 12px
  adherence label/percentage gap, a right-aligned visualization column, no
  horizontal overflow, and no browser warnings or errors.
- Browser QA: authenticated local `/behaviors` at 390x844 confirmed all seven
  weekday labels use 0px borders and 32px compact minimum heights, the helper
  sentence is absent, the settled document width matches the viewport, and no
  browser warnings or errors appeared. The fixture-backed BehaviorList preview
  additionally confirmed 0px expanded-content top padding, a 4px metadata row
  gap, and 20px metadata line height.

Remaining risk:
- The refinement is verified locally but has not been deployed to hosted
  production yet.

### Marketing homepage critique fixes (2026-07-12)

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Ran the project Impeccable critique on the marketing homepage, which scored
  28/40 with three P1 findings.
- Fixed the mobile hero clipping risk and flat H1/H2 scale, completed the
  banned-pattern copy pass, replaced the icon-card grid with one ledger panel,
  and removed border-plus-shadow pairs and monospace-as-costume styling.
- Resized the Cadence logo assets, removed the unused oversized hero export,
  and codified the marketing register exceptions in `DESIGN.md`.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run marketing:build`.
- Pass: `node scripts/check-agent-readability.mjs` from `apps/marketing`.
- Pass: Impeccable detector returned `[]` for the homepage and base layout.
- Pass: generated homepage HTML and Markdown contain no em dash characters.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.

### Analytics summary unresolved alignment

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated the Analytics top summary Unresolved count to match the Timeline Needs decision count.
- The top summary now counts only active unresolved occurrences before the current local day, regardless of the selected Analytics range.
- Current-day unresolved occurrences still appear in the Analytics heatmap and behavior/category detail counts so the current-day state remains visible.
- Added `behaviorActive` to analytics resolver input from the analytics service so archived prior unresolved occurrences do not affect the top summary count.
- Updated product/UI/user-flow/design docs to document the aligned summary semantics.
- No schema changes, route changes, provider operations, or out-of-scope features were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts tests/timeline.resolver.test.ts`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run test` (25 files, 157 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/analytics` showed summary `Unresolved: 0` while `/timeline` showed `Open Needs decision, 0 prior unresolved occurrences`; `/analytics` had no browser warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- Behavior/category detail counts may still show current-day unresolved occurrences by design; only the top summary Unresolved count is aligned to Needs decision.

### Analytics calendar completion intensity

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated the overall Analytics calendar from a binary completed/not-completed treatment to completion-intensity day cells.
- Overall day cells now carry `completionRate`; fully completed days use the full completed color, partial days mix the completed color with the background by completed share, and days with no completions use the background end of the scale without a diagonal overlay.
- Added the `partial` overall day state in the analytics resolver/type contract and updated resolver tests for a 50% completed day.
- Updated the Analytics legend, design-system Analytics fixture, product/UI/user-flow/design docs, and browser QA coverage for the new shade-only visual semantics.
- No schema changes, route changes, provider operations, or out-of-scope features were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/scan_inventory.py --root . --out /tmp/cadence-design-system.manifest.json`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/scan_usages.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --out /tmp/cadence-design-system.usage.json`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/verify_traceability.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --usage design-system.usage.json --bench app/design-system/page.tsx`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run test` (25 files, 157 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/analytics` showed live fractional `data-completion-rate` values, proportional computed blue shades, the Partial legend item, zero diagonal overlays in the overall calendar and legend, no horizontal overflow at desktop or 390px mobile, and no browser warnings/errors.
- Browser QA: `/design-system` at 390px showed the partial Analytics fixture cell, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warnings/errors.

Remaining risk:
- Fully unresolved days intentionally remain neutral; unresolved occurrences reduce a mixed day's completion shade because the shade represents completion share across all scheduled occurrences for that day. A 0% completed resolved day is intentionally the background end of the shade scale.

### Analytics layout simplification and tracking starts

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Removed boxed section-panel treatment from the Analytics screen and converted the page to unboxed report sections separated by horizontal dividers.
- Merged the overall calendar into the Overall adherence area and moved the calendar legend behind a See Legend disclosure.
- Removed the empty selected-day Not Completed panel; selected-day Not Completed details now render only when the selected day has rows.
- Added per-behavior tracking start metadata from `behaviors.created_at`, converted through Temporal in the behavior timezone, and surfaced it as Tracking since text plus a start marker in each behavior heatmap when the start day is in range.
- Reshaped behavior and category status counts into vertical label/value rows with numeric values aligned to the right.
- Updated Analytics resolver tests, the design-system Analytics fixture, product/UI/user-flow/design docs, and this status ledger.
- No schema changes, route changes, provider operations, or out-of-scope features were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts`
- Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/eslint components/analytics/AnalyticsScreen.tsx lib/resolvers/analytics.resolver.ts lib/services/analytics.service.ts tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts app/design-system/page.tsx`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/scan_inventory.py --root . --out /tmp/cadence-design-system.manifest.json`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/scan_usages.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --out /tmp/cadence-design-system.usage.json`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/verify_traceability.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --usage design-system.usage.json --bench app/design-system/page.tsx`
- Pass: `git diff --check`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run test` (25 files, 158 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/analytics` at desktop width showed zero boxed section wrappers, the calendar inside Overall adherence, See Legend closed by default and revealing the legend on click, no empty selected-day Not Completed panel, Tracking since text and `data-tracking-start` cells for behavior rows, label/value status rows, no horizontal overflow, and no warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/analytics` at 390px showed zero boxed section wrappers, no horizontal overflow, no empty selected-day Not Completed panel, behavior count values to the right of their labels, Tracking since text and start markers, and See Legend closed by default.

Remaining risk:
- The visible heatmap start marker is intentionally subtle and relies on the adjacent Tracking since text for human-readable context.

### Timeline mobile adaptation

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Adapted the Timeline mobile layout while preserving the desktop ledger treatment.
- Kept occurrence rows unboxed and kept native disclosure without adding a chevron or separate disclosure icon.
- Moved mobile status actions into a full-width touch row before expanded details, increased mobile status and note action tap targets, made grouped stacks breathe more on mobile, and adapted the Needs decision button/modal for mobile safe areas.
- Browser-comment follow-up removed the mobile divider between the occurrence time/title row and the Completed/Not Completed action row while preserving the mobile touch row spacing.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `DESIGN.md` so the mobile Timeline behavior and no-chevron choice are documented.
- Updated `design-system.usage.json` Timeline line references for the restructured occurrence row.
- No schema, resolver, provider, reminder, export, analytics, or out-of-scope product behavior changes were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test` (19 files, 115 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/scan_inventory.py --root . --out /tmp/cadence-design-system.manifest.json`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/scan_usages.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --out /tmp/cadence-design-system.usage.json`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/verify_traceability.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --usage design-system.usage.json --bench app/design-system/page.tsx`
- Browser QA: `/design-system` at 390px width reported no horizontal overflow; closed occurrence details were hidden; the first status action measured 44px tall; expanding the occurrence row showed details as a grid with the status row before details and no chevron text detected; browser logs showed no warnings or errors.
- Follow-up pass: `npm run agents:check`; `npm run resolvers:check`; `./node_modules/.bin/eslint components/timeline/OccurrenceRow.tsx`; `npm run test` (19 files, 115 tests); `npm run design-system:check`; `git diff --check -- components/timeline/OccurrenceRow.tsx`.
- Follow-up browser QA: `/timeline` at 430px wide reported `statusBorderTopWidth: "0px"` for the occurrence status row and no horizontal overflow.
- Follow-up unblock: after regenerating `lib/db/database.types.ts` during BehaviorLog milestone verification, full `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build` passed again.

Remaining risk:
- The in-app browser did not open the fixed Needs decision modal from the design-system bench trigger despite the trigger being visible and no console errors being present, so modal open/close interaction was not verified in browser QA during this pass.

### Behaviors page critique follow-up

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Completed all priority fixes from the Behaviors page impeccable critique.
- Worker 1 changed `/behaviors` so the create form sits behind a native disclosure, stays closed when existing behaviors are present, and opens by default only for a no-behavior empty state.
- Worker 2 changed `BehaviorList` so per-card edit forms lazy-mount only after the card's edit disclosure is opened.
- Added a first-class Restore action for archived behaviors through the existing server action/service/repository path; Restore sets `active=true`, clears `archived_at`, and re-syncs occurrences.
- Improved segmented radio focus visibility for schedule and recurrence controls.
- Tightened behavior copy from "Schedule times" to "Scheduled for", "Every N days" to "Every few days", and recurrence unit labels to singular/plural text without `day(s)`-style wording.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `DESIGN.md` to reflect the collapsed create form, lazy edit pattern, and Restore affordance.
- No schema changes, resolver changes, provider operations, or out-of-scope product features were added.

Verification:
- Pass: Worker 1 `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: Worker 2 `npm run typecheck`; `npm run agents:check`; `npm run resolvers:check`; `npm run lint`; `npm run test`; `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (18 files, 103 tests).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/scan_inventory.py --root . --out /tmp/cadence-design-system.manifest.json`.
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/scan_usages.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --out /tmp/cadence-design-system.usage.json`.
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/verify_traceability.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --usage design-system.usage.json --bench app/design-system/page.tsx`.
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/behaviors` desktop render showed create disclosure closed, Active and Archived sections present, 8 Archive buttons, 3 Restore buttons, no horizontal overflow, and 0 mounted edit forms while cards were closed.
- Browser QA: opening one behavior edit disclosure mounted exactly 1 edit form, showed "Every few days", showed "Scheduled for", and confirmed focus-styled segmented labels were present.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/behaviors` at 390px width showed the Active behaviors heading near the top of the viewport, create disclosure closed, 8 Archive buttons, 3 Restore buttons, no horizontal overflow, and 0 mounted edit forms while cards were closed.

Remaining risk:
- Restore was verified through render-level browser QA and build/type checks; a live database restore click was not performed to avoid changing the user's behavior data during QA.

### Behavior schedule slots

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added exact-time and preset time-range schedule slots for behaviors, including multiple slots per behavior.
- Added migration `20260609202707_add_behavior_schedule_slots.sql` with `behavior_schedule_slots`, occurrence schedule snapshot fields, RLS policies, and backfill from existing `behaviors.scheduled_time`.
- Updated behavior form parsing/UI, behavior repositories/services, occurrence generation, reminder email variables, Timeline grouping, analytics labels, export formats, generated database types, docs, and tests.
- Timeline grouping keeps each scheduled time/range as its own occurrence row, avoids progress-fill grouped rows, avoids "1 of 2 completed" labels, and keeps partial completion as a derived visual result only.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`
- Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts`
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behavior-form.test.ts tests/occurrence.resolver.test.ts tests/timeline.resolver.test.ts tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts tests/export.resolver.test.ts tests/reminder.resolver.test.ts tests/reminder.service.test.ts`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`

- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/scan_usages.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --out /tmp/cadence-design-system.usage.json`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/verify_traceability.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --usage design-system.usage.json --bench app/design-system/page.tsx`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run test`
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: `/design-system` desktop fixture render shows the new schedule editor, range cues, grouped Timeline range rows, no "1 of 2 completed" label, no horizontal overflow, and no bench-specific warning/error logs observed beyond the earlier authenticated route error already noted below.
- Browser QA: `/design-system` at 390px width shows the new schedule editor, range cues, grouped Timeline range rows, no "1 of 2 completed" label, and no horizontal overflow.

Remaining risk:
- Authenticated `/behaviors` and `/timeline` render against the configured hosted Supabase database will fail until the new migration is deployed to hosted Supabase. Hosted `db push` was not run because it requires explicit user authorization.

### Timeline Needs decision modal

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Replaced the inline Needs decision section on `/timeline` with a fixed lower-right Needs decision button and modal.
- The button shows the current prior-unresolved occurrence count and uses the primary visual treatment when there are decisions pending.
- The modal renders the same resolver-produced Needs decision day groups and occurrence rows, preserving Completed, Not Completed, and Note actions without duplicating timeline grouping logic.
- Updated `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, `docs/ROUTE_MAP.md`, and `DESIGN.md` so the source of truth matches the modal-based interaction.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test`
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` desktop render shows no inline Needs decision section, shows the fixed lower-right count button, and reports no console warnings or errors.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390px width has no horizontal overflow, no inline Needs decision section, and the fixed count button remains within the viewport.

Remaining risk:
- The active browser-comment overlay in the in-app browser inserted `#codex-browser-sidebar-comments-root` above the page with pointer events enabled. This blocked click/key event delivery for all client toggles tested, including the existing mobile navigation button, so modal open/close interaction could not be verified in that annotated browser surface.

### Design system bench adoption

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added a local/dev-only `/design-system` bench route that renders existing product UI components with static fixture data. The route is outside primary navigation, calls no Supabase services, and returns `notFound()` in production builds.
- Added required foundation and primitive sections for typography, font scale, color, spacing, radius, border, shadow, motion, and common product control patterns.
- Added trace cards for 18 tracked UI entries, including the app shell, screen frame, primary navigation registry, login button, Timeline, Behaviors, Analytics, Export, Settings, and supporting Timeline/Behavior/Export modules.
- Added `design-system.config.json`, `design-system.manifest.json`, `design-system.usage.json`, and `scripts/check-design-system.mjs`; `npm run design-system:check` is separate from the existing required checks.
- Added the short `design-system-bench` routing hook to `AGENTS.md` and documented the internal route in `docs/ROUTE_MAP.md`.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: post-bench temporary inventory and usage rescans; `app/design-system` did not enter inventory or product usage, and usage summary stayed at 25 product usages / 0 bench previews.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`

- Browser QA: `http://localhost:3000/design-system` at 390px width showed 18 trace cards, the Needs decision product preview control, no horizontal overflow, and no browser console warnings or errors.

Remaining risk:
- A Next dev server was already running on port 3000 during QA. The bench was verified through that server; no server restart was performed.

### Quiet border system

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Replaced product UI `border-2` and color-specific border treatments with the shared 1px `border-line` quiet divider across the app shell, auth, Timeline, Behaviors, Analytics, Export, Settings, and design-system previews.
- Updated the `/design-system` Border foundation so controls and panels use the same quiet divider instead of documenting a separate 2px major-border style.
- Updated `DESIGN.md` so the source-of-truth visual system now defines one 1px Ash Line border rule for product dividers, controls, panels, rows, inputs, overlays, and heatmap cells.

### Courier New typography stack

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Replaced the product font family stack in `app/globals.css` with `Courier New` for the Tailwind `font-sans`, Tailwind `font-mono`, and body font declarations.
- Updated the `/design-system` Typography foundation row and product preview wrapper so the bench displays and computes `Courier New` instead of the previous Courier/Courier New/monospace stack.
- Updated `DESIGN.md` so the design-system source of truth names `Courier New` as the single product font family.

Remaining risk:
- A Next dev server was already running on port 3000 during QA. The bench was verified through that server; no server restart was performed.

### Timeline status refresh

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated `components/timeline/StatusButtons.tsx` to call `router.refresh()` after a successful status server action.
- The server action still owns persistence and calls `revalidatePath("/timeline")`; the refresh only asks the current route to consume the fresh resolver-produced Timeline payload.
- Preserved the existing Needs decision semantics: the floating button and modal count prior-day unresolved occurrences only.

- Browser QA: read-only authenticated `/timeline` render showed the floating Needs decision button count and open modal count both at `3`, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA did not click a real Completed or Not Completed button because that would mutate the user's actual behavior history.
- Current-day completions do not reduce the Needs decision count by design; that count is derived only from unresolved occurrences before the current local date.

### IBM Plex Sans typography stack

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added the Next.js `IBM_Plex_Sans` font to `app/layout.tsx` and applied both its generated body class and CSS variable at the root layout.
- Updated `app/globals.css` so the Tailwind `font-sans`, Tailwind `font-mono`, and body font declarations use IBM Plex Sans with standard sans fallbacks.
- Updated the `/design-system` Typography foundation row and product preview wrapper so the bench displays and computes `IBM Plex Sans`.
- Updated `DESIGN.md` so the design-system source of truth names IBM Plex Sans as the single product font family.
- Restarted the existing local `next dev` server on port 3000 after browser QA found a stale generated Tailwind CSS chunk from the prior Courier New stack.

Remaining risk:
- Historical `STATUS.md` entries still describe the prior Courier New work, but live source and current design docs now use IBM Plex Sans.

### Fixed sidebar and unframed behavior form

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated `components/layout/AppShell.tsx` so the desktop sidebar is truly fixed while page content scrolls, with the main content padded by the expanded or collapsed sidebar width.
- Narrowed the collapsed desktop sidebar to a 64px icon rail, centered the expand/collapse button with the nav icons, and removed boxed borders around sidebar navigation items.
- Removed the outer border and padding from the Behaviors page Create behavior section while preserving the form controls and inner field-group dividers.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and the design-system bench navigation preview/usage metadata so the source-of-truth and trace files match the new UI treatment.

- Browser QA: authenticated `/behaviors` at 1024x768 showed fixed expanded sidebar metrics, `main` left padding at 288px, sidebar nav item borders at `0px`, and the Create behavior section with `0px` border and `0px` padding.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/behaviors` collapsed at 1024x768 showed a 64px fixed sidebar, `main` left padding at 64px, expand/collapse button and all nav icons centered at the same x coordinate, and nav item borders at `0px`.
- Browser QA: `/behaviors` at 390px showed no horizontal overflow; the mobile drawer opened to 288px, kept nav item borders at `0px`, and stayed within the viewport.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/timeline` at 1024x768 after scrolling showed the sidebar fixed at top `0`, `main` left padding at 288px, no horizontal overflow, and nav item borders at `0px`.

Remaining risk:
- The `/timeline` browser QA route took one slow first render during local dev before the layout metrics were collected; the measured layout state passed after the page loaded.
- After resetting the temporary browser viewport, local dev Supabase auth fetches began timing out and the cleanup navigation landed on `/login?next=%2Fbehaviors`; the authenticated `/behaviors` and `/timeline` layout checks had already completed.

### Behavior form timezone removal and recurrence flattening

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Removed the Timezone display panel from the Behavior create/edit form; timezone remains owned by Settings and is still applied server-side from the profile/default timezone during behavior creation.
- Removed the Recurrence editor's outer bordered panel while preserving its semantic fieldset, segmented recurrence presets, and weekday/monthly controls.
- Changed Recurrence subsection labels such as Every, On, and Day to smaller muted heading text.
- Tightened the desktop sidebar from 288px to 256px expanded and from 64px to 56px collapsed, with matching main-content offsets.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, the design-system bench preview usage, and design-system trace metadata to match the new form and shell treatment.

- Browser QA: authenticated `/behaviors` at 1024x768 showed a fixed 256px sidebar, `main` left padding at 256px, no timezone block in the form, a 0px border/0px padding Recurrence fieldset, and no horizontal overflow.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/behaviors` collapsed at 1024x768 showed a 56px sidebar, `main` left padding at 56px, and the expand/collapse button plus all nav icons centered on the same x coordinate.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/behaviors` at 390px showed no horizontal overflow, no timezone block, and a 0px border/0px padding Recurrence fieldset.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/timeline` at 1024x768 after scrolling showed the sidebar fixed at top `0`, a 256px sidebar width, `main` left padding at 256px, and no horizontal overflow.

Remaining risk:
- Local dev-server logs showed transient Supabase DNS/auth fetch failures before browser QA, but the server recovered and authenticated `/behaviors` and `/timeline` layout QA completed successfully.

### Reminder editor flattening

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated `components/behaviors/ReminderEditor.tsx` so the Reminders fieldset uses the same unframed form-section treatment as Recurrence, with no outer border or padding.
- Changed the Reminder offset label to the smaller muted subsection-heading style.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md` and `DESIGN.md` so Reminders, Recurrence, and the Behavior form source-of-truth describe the same unframed pattern.
- While verifying, aligned the existing in-progress schedule-slot work with TypeScript by updating generated database types for the existing `behavior_schedule_slots` migration, schedule-slot service/test fixtures, design-system preview fixtures, analytics/export test fixtures, and behavior/export mapping fixtures.

- Browser QA: `/design-system` at 390px width showed the Reminders fieldset at `0px` border and `0px` padding with no horizontal overflow.

Remaining risk:
- Authenticated `/behaviors` browser QA is currently blocked by the connected Supabase schema/cache returning `PGRST200` for the `behaviors` to `behavior_schedule_slots` relationship. The migration and docs exist locally, but the connected database was not updated in this task because hosted schema deployment requires explicit authorization.

### Hosted schedule-slot schema deployment and embed repair

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Pushed hosted Supabase migration `20260609202707_add_behavior_schedule_slots.sql`, bringing the connected remote schema back in line with local migrations.
- Confirmed the hosted schema now has `behavior_schedule_slots` and occurrence schedule snapshot columns.
- Fixed `lib/db/behaviors.repo.ts` to embed `schedule_slots` through the explicit owner-scoped `behavior_schedule_slots_behavior_owner_fkey` relationship, resolving PostgREST `PGRST201` ambiguity after the schema migration was deployed.
- Triggered a production Vercel redeploy with empty commit `c9989b8` (`chore: trigger Vercel redeploy`) before making the code repair, then verified deployment `dpl_F7zEzJBMshqwAA6DkJRHSUus6u4R` reached `READY`.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes`
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list --linked`

Remaining risk:
- None known for the hosted schedule-slot schema and behavior schedule-slot embed issue.

### Timeline completion chime

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added the user-provided MP3 as `public/sounds/completion-chime.mp3`.
- Added client-side completion feedback so `StatusButtons` preloads the chime and plays it only after a successful user-initiated status change into Completed.
- Kept Not Completed, note saves, page refreshes, and re-saving an already Completed occurrence silent.
- Follow-up: changed playback to fetch the MP3 during preload, create/resume the browser audio context during the user's submit gesture, and play the decoded chime only after the status server action reports success. This addresses browser policies that can block first-click audio when `play()` is called only after the async save returns.
- Documented the chime behavior in `docs/UI_SPEC.md` and `DESIGN.md`.
- Added `lib/ui/completion-feedback.ts` and paired tests for the completion-chime decision rule.
- Updated the design-system bench preview to pass the existing `restoreAction` prop required by the in-progress BehaviorList work, and excluded non-rendering `lib/ui/**` helpers from auto-inventory scans.

- Pass: design-system-bench classify/theme detection plus inventory and usage rescans to temporary files; inventory stayed focused on 18 rendered components and did not retain the audio helper as a visual module after config exclusion.
- Pass: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/sounds/completion-chime.mp3` returned `200 OK` with `Content-Type: audio/mpeg`.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` desktop render showed Completed controls, no horizontal overflow, and no warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390px width showed Completed controls, no horizontal overflow, and no warning/error logs.
- Follow-up Browser QA: local `/design-system#ds-module-status-buttons` rendered the fixture Completed button and reported no warning/error logs, but its server-action mock did not submit in the in-app browser fixture; no product data was changed.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA did not click a real Completed button because that would mutate the user's actual behavior history. The client decision rule is covered by tests, and the audio asset route is verified.

### Timeline Not Completed approval controls

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated the Timeline resolver display metadata so `not_completed` occurrences expose the same collapsed Completed / Not Completed controls as an unresolved decision row, with Not Completed indicated as the current choice.
- Completed rows continue to use the full blue resolved treatment and collapsed status label instead of primary buttons.
- Updated the Timeline UI source-of-truth docs and design-system occurrence-row fixture so Not Completed rows are documented and previewed as approval-ready, without adding a new stored status or changing Needs decision semantics.

- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` default-width render showed the selected Not Completed row with collapsed Completed and Not Completed buttons, Not Completed `aria-pressed="true"`, Completed rows still label-only, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390px width showed the same Not Completed collapsed controls, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA did not click the status buttons because that would mutate the user's actual behavior history. The resolver display contract is covered by `tests/timeline.resolver.test.ts`.

### Timeline Not Completed original surface

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated `components/timeline/OccurrenceRow.tsx` so `not_completed` rows use the same `bg-background` collapsed card surface and `bg-surface` expanded-detail surface as the original unresolved row.
- Preserved the prior behavior where `not_completed` rows expose both collapsed Completed and Not Completed buttons, with Not Completed indicated as the current choice.
- Confirmed no schema migration is needed: the existing `occurrences` row already stores `status`, `completed_at`, and `status_marked_at` per scheduled occurrence instance.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `DESIGN.md` to call this a visual reset while preserving the stored `not_completed` status on the occurrence instance.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`

- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` default-width render showed Not Completed rows on `bg-background` with collapsed Completed and Not Completed buttons, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390px width showed the 9:00 AM Not Completed row on `bg-background` with both buttons, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA did not click status buttons because that would mutate the user's actual behavior history. No data-model risk is known for this visual treatment change.

### Font scale downshift

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Shifted the app's Tailwind text scale down one step at the shared token level in `app/globals.css`; existing `text-*` utilities now render smaller across product UI and product previews.
- Updated the `/design-system` Font scale foundation to show Display 30, Heading 24, Section 20, Body 14, and Label 12 with matching computed sizes.
- Updated `DESIGN.md` so the typography source of truth matches the implemented scale.
- During verification, fixed a hook dependency warning in `components/timeline/StatusButtons.tsx` and a lint-only `this` alias in `tests/completion-feedback.test.ts` from the existing completion-chime worktree changes.

- Browser QA: `/design-system` at 1042x863 showed the Font scale foundation with computed sizes Display 30, Heading 24, Section 20, Body 14, and Label 12; no horizontal overflow.
- Browser QA: `/design-system` at 390x844 showed the same computed font-scale values, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- The change was verified on the design-system bench and fixture-backed product previews. Authenticated product-route click flows were not exercised because this was a shared typography-token change and should not mutate user data.

### No-bold typography experiment

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added shared font-weight token overrides in `app/globals.css` so Tailwind weight utilities from `font-medium` through `font-black` render at normal `400` weight.
- Added native-element resets for headings, semantic bold text, table headers, definition terms, and summaries so browser defaults do not reintroduce bolding.
- Updated `DESIGN.md` so the typography contract describes all hierarchy levels at `400` weight and notes that this is a no-bold experiment.

Verification:
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/classify_repo.py --root .`

- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: `/design-system` at desktop width showed bench chrome and Font scale samples all computed at `font-weight: 400`; no horizontal overflow.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/timeline` at desktop width showed sampled title, nav, button, section heading, and body text all computed at `font-weight: 400`; no horizontal overflow.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/timeline` at 390x844 showed sampled mobile brand, menu button, page title, section heading, and body text all computed at `font-weight: 400`; no horizontal overflow and no warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- This is intentionally a broad visual experiment. It preserves existing component class names, so future reversion can remove the shared token overrides without editing every component.

### Completion chime diagnostics follow-up

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Diagnosed the completion chime path after reports that Completed did not trigger sound.
- Confirmed `/sounds/completion-chime.mp3` is served locally as `audio/mpeg`; the remaining likely causes were browser activation timing after async server actions, loss of submitted status intent, transient preload failure caching, and embedded-browser media API gaps.
- Changed `StatusButtons` so Completed and Not Completed are submitted through separate structural forms with hidden `occurrence_id` and `status` fields instead of relying on `SubmitEvent.submitter`.
- The status server action now echoes the submitted status in `OccurrenceActionState`; `StatusButtons` uses that server-confirmed status after success while still priming audio on pointer/click/submit before the async action returns.
- Further hardened `StatusButtons` so it captures the submitted status and current status at the user gesture, then requires a successful server-confirmed `completed` result before playback. A later render cannot cause a chime without that captured user intent.
- Split the media-element gesture primer from the media element used for audible playback so delayed muted-primer cleanup cannot pause, reset, or mute the real chime.
- Hardened `lib/ui/completion-feedback.ts` to prime Web Audio with a silent one-sample source, unlock an `HTMLAudioElement` during the user gesture, prefer the media element for actual audible playback, keep Web Audio as fallback, retry failed preload/decode attempts, guard missing `AudioContext`/`Audio` APIs, and emit dev-only playback/blocked diagnostics.
- Added a final compatibility fallback for browsers where media playback rejects and the MP3 buffer cannot load or decode: when Web Audio oscillator/gain nodes are available and the context can run, Cadence now plays one very short, low-gain synthesized chime before reporting playback blocked.
- Changed the Timeline refresh sequence so `router.refresh()` waits until the chime playback path has started instead of immediately refreshing after the successful status action.
- Follow-up production listener QA showed two real production Completed clicks reached hydrated React status forms, but neither emitted `cadence:completion-chime-played` nor `cadence:completion-chime-blocked`. The issue was the status server action calling `revalidatePath("/timeline")` before the client success effect could run; completing an occurrence can remove or replace the submitting action component, losing the pending chime effect.
- Removed the eager Timeline revalidation from `markOccurrenceStatusAction`. `StatusButtons` already refreshes the Timeline after success and completion feedback, so server confirmation is preserved while avoiding the unmount race.
- Production deployment `dpl_HJXgLVV75HTFGbGVY6YYbpVMRywF` from commit `a7f824221aabbc3b756b08a426f447efa0d3b02f` was ready and aliased to `https://cadence-blush-three.vercel.app` on 2026-06-19.
- Updated the design-system fixture action to mirror the real status action's `nextStatus` return for fixture-backed browser QA.
- No schema, resolver, product-scope, notification-provider, or real occurrence-data changes were made.

Verification:
- Pass: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/sounds/completion-chime.mp3` returned `200 OK` with `Content-Type: audio/mpeg`.
- Pass: `curl -I http://localhost:3002/sounds/completion-chime.mp3` returned `200 OK` with `Content-Type: audio/mpeg` from the current Cadence dev server.

- Pass: Production Chrome listener attached to `https://cadence-blush-three.vercel.app/timeline` captured two user-clicked Completed submits with `status: "completed"` and hydrated React `onPointerDown`/`onClick`/`onSubmit` handlers present, but no chime played/blocked events before the local fix.
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/completion-feedback.test.ts` after removing eager status-action revalidation.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run test` (32 files, 227 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Pass: Vercel production deployment `dpl_HJXgLVV75HTFGbGVY6YYbpVMRywF` reached `READY`, with canonical alias `cadence-blush-three.vercel.app` and commit `a7f824221aabbc3b756b08a426f447efa0d3b02f`.
- Pass: Production smoke after deploy: `/login` returned 200; `/timeline`, `/behaviors`, `/settings`, `/analytics`, and `/export` redirected unauthenticated requests to `/login?next=...`; `/api/reminders/process` returned 401 without a secret; `/sounds/completion-chime.mp3` returned 200 with `Content-Type: audio/mpeg`.
- Pass: Vercel runtime logs showed no production warning/error/fatal entries in the 15 minutes around the deployment smoke check.
- Pass: design-system-bench classify/theme detection, inventory and usage scans to `/tmp`, and `npm run design-system:check`; a freshly generated full traceability verification still reports unrelated in-progress Settings/Timezone bench coverage gaps from the current dirty worktree, so no design-system source files were changed for this chime-only pass.
- Browser QA: Chrome remote-debugging profile loaded local `/design-system#ds-module-status-buttons`, clicked the fixture Completed control through CDP mouse events, received the bench server-action success message, and observed `cadence:completion-chime-played` with `source: "media"`.
- Browser QA: After the eager-revalidation fix, Chrome loaded local `http://localhost:3002/design-system#ds-module-status-buttons`, clicked the fixture Completed control, and observed `cadence:completion-chime-played` with `source: "media"`.
- Browser QA: in-app browser `/design-system#ds-module-status-buttons` rendered Completed and Not Completed controls and the fixture action completed without mutating product data. The in-app browser reports `AudioContext`, `Audio`, and `Notification` as unavailable, so it cannot prove audible playback in that embedded surface.
- Browser QA: Chrome plugin fresh tab `/design-system#ds-module-status-buttons` clicked Completed and logged `cadence:completion-chime-played media`, confirming the normal browser media element playback path started. The only observed Chrome warning was an extension-injected hydration mismatch, unrelated to audio.
- Browser QA: Chrome design-system `NotificationPermissionPanel` preview showed the `Permission` row, `Browser push` row, and `Enable browser reminders` control. The fixture has no VAPID key, so the control was disabled and no permission prompt was opened or accepted.
- Browser QA: in-app browser `NotificationPermissionPanel` preview showed the `Permission` row and `Enable browser reminders` control, with permission blocked/unavailable in that embedded surface.

Remaining risk:
- The in-app browser cannot play or authorize audio because its media and notification APIs are unavailable; Chrome verified the actual media playback-start path.
- The synthesized compatibility fallback is covered by unit tests only. The real Chrome fixture used the preferred media element path, so the fallback was not forced in browser QA.
- Browser notification permission prompts were not accepted during QA. The permission label/control is present, and prompt triggering remains owned by Settings with real push configuration.

### Timeline status action text links

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Changed `components/timeline/StatusButtons.tsx` so Timeline Completed and Not Completed actions render as inline text-link controls instead of boxed filled/outlined buttons, while retaining the check and x icons.
- Kept semantic submit buttons under the hood so keyboard access, form submission, pending state, `aria-pressed`, and completion chime preparation remain intact.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `DESIGN.md` so future Timeline work preserves text-link status actions instead of reintroducing button chrome.
- No schema, resolver, service, API route, provider, or product-scope changes were made.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`

- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` desktop render showed Completed and Not Completed controls with transparent background, `0px` border width, retained icons, current-choice underline where applicable, and no warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390px width showed the text-link status actions wrapping without horizontal overflow and no warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA did not click status actions because that would mutate the user's actual occurrence history. The existing fixture-backed StatusButtons path remains covered by the design-system bench.

### Timeline borderless row polish

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Removed perimeter borders from Timeline occurrence rows and tightened row rhythm with a 4px list gap plus compact 10-12px row padding.
- Removed the Timeline page helper sentence under the title.
- Removed the border from the mobile top-bar navigation icon button.
- Removed the internal divider between the number and text in the floating Needs decision button while keeping its outer button affordance.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and the local design-system typography preview so the documented visual direction matches the implemented Timeline.
- No schema, resolver, service, API route, provider, or product-scope changes were made.

- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 942px width showed no Timeline helper text, occurrence row border widths at `0px`, list `rowGap: 4px`, row padding at `12px`, mobile menu trigger border widths at `0px`, Needs decision count span border widths at `0px`, no horizontal overflow, and no warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390px width showed no Timeline helper text, occurrence row border widths at `0px`, list `rowGap: 4px`, row padding at `10px`, mobile menu trigger border widths at `0px`, Needs decision count span border widths at `0px`, no horizontal overflow, and no warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA was visual/read-only. Status actions and the Needs decision modal were not clicked to avoid mutating the user's live occurrence history.

### Timeline status action underline affordance

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Changed `components/timeline/StatusButtons.tsx` so all Timeline status text-link actions are underlined by default.
- Follow-up: normalized Completed and Not Completed action underlines to the same thin `decoration-1` treatment so Not Completed no longer receives a saved-status thickness cue.
- Removed `aria-pressed` from the status action controls because the controls are submit actions, not the row's status indicator.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `DESIGN.md` to document consistent thin underlines and avoid current-choice styling for Not Completed rows.
- No schema, resolver, service, API route, provider, or product-scope changes were made.

- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` desktop render showed sampled Completed and Not Completed status actions with transparent backgrounds, 0px borders, `textDecorationLine: underline`, `textDecorationThickness: 1px`, and no `aria-pressed`; no warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390px width showed the same sampled status action styles, no horizontal overflow, and no warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA was visual/read-only. Status actions were not clicked to avoid mutating the user's live occurrence history.

### Timeline browser comment polish

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Removed the visible Timeline page title so the Timeline feed starts directly with the current-day section while preserving an `sr-only` page heading for accessibility.
- Reworked Timeline occurrence rows so scheduled labels use a fixed column and behavior title first letters align across exact times and preset ranges.
- Added compact Timeline-only preset labels, so range occurrences display `Morning`, `Afternoon`, `Evening`, or `Night` without the full clock range; export, analytics, and reminder labels can still use the full range text.
- Added soft blue hover hues for unresolved and Needs decision rows, with a darker blue hover for Completed rows.
- Reworked expanded occurrence row layout so status actions stay pinned to the top-right and the expanded detail panel spans the full inner row width.
- Changed Timeline Completed status actions to use black text like Not Completed.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, the design-system Timeline fixture, and `design-system.usage.json` to match the implemented Timeline state.
- Added `tests/schedule.test.ts` coverage for full versus compact schedule labels.
- No schema, resolver, provider, status semantics, notification behavior, or product-scope changes were made.

- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 942px width showed no visible Timeline page title, the current-day section at the top of the content, zero horizontal overflow, compact `Evening` range labels, aligned behavior-title x positions, black Completed/Not Completed actions, and emitted hover CSS for `#eef6ff`, `#e8f2ff`, and `#2f669f`.
- Browser QA: opening the second current-day row kept status actions top-aligned with the summary (`0px` top delta) and measured the expanded details panel at the full inner row width.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390px width showed no visible Timeline page title, zero horizontal overflow, compact `Evening` range labels, and aligned behavior-title x positions.
- Browser QA: no warning or error logs were observed in the in-app browser after the Timeline checks.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA was visual/read-only. Status action clicks were not performed to avoid mutating the user's live occurrence history.
- The in-app browser did not report `:hover` state from synthetic pointer movement, so hover was verified by emitted CSS and row class output rather than a live hover screenshot.

### Timeline row vertical alignment polish

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Centered collapsed Timeline row contents so scheduled time, behavior title, collapsed status text, and Completed / Not Completed action text share the row's vertical midpoint.
- Preserved the expanded-row layout by returning status controls to top alignment when a row's details are open on desktop.
- Added a targeted Timeline status-action hover/focus weight rule so Completed and Not Completed become heavier on hover/focus without changing the global no-bold typography tokens.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md` and `DESIGN.md` to document the centered collapsed-row treatment and the status-link hover exception.
- No resolver, service, schema, provider, status semantic, or product-scope changes were made.

- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 1042x863 showed the selected `Clean Invisalign` row with time, title, status wrapper, Completed, and Not Completed all at `0px` vertical center delta from the row midpoint, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390x844 showed the selected row fitting within the viewport with no horizontal overflow and no browser warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: emitted page CSS includes `.timeline-status-action:not(:disabled):hover, .timeline-status-action:focus-visible { font-weight: 600; }` and the expanded-row `:has(details[open])` alignment rule.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA was visual/read-only. Status action clicks were not performed to avoid mutating the user's live occurrence history.

### Timeline status hover color refinement

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Removed the hover color shift from Timeline Completed and Not Completed text-link status actions while preserving the targeted hover/focus heavier text treatment.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md` and `DESIGN.md` so the status-action contract says hover/focus may become heavier without changing color.
- No resolver, service, schema, provider, status semantic, or product-scope changes were made.

- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 1042x863 showed the selected `Clean Invisalign` row with two Timeline status actions, no `hover:text-primary` class, no hover color CSS for `.timeline-status-action`, and no horizontal overflow or browser warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390x844 showed the selected row with no `hover:text-primary` status-action class, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA was visual/read-only. Status action clicks were not performed to avoid mutating the user's live occurrence history.

### Timeline sidebar and hover stability polish

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Changed the desktop app-shell brand label from `Cadence Tracker` to `Cadence`, matching the mobile header.
- Tied the active primary navigation item directly to the shared `--primary` blue token used by completed Timeline rows and primary card states.
- Reduced the Timeline occurrence summary gap between the scheduled time column and behavior title from `0.75rem` to `0.25rem`.
- Replaced the Timeline status-action hover/focus `font-weight` change with non-reflowing text-shadow emphasis so hovering Not Completed does not move the neighboring Completed action.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md` and `DESIGN.md` to document non-reflowing status-action hover/focus emphasis.
- No resolver, service, schema, provider, status semantic, notification behavior, or product-scope changes were made.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`

- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 854x863 showed sidebar label `Cadence`, active Timeline nav background `rgb(53, 114, 179)` matching `--primary: #3572b3`, row column gap `4px`, no horizontal overflow, no warning/error logs, and emitted status-action hover/focus CSS using `text-shadow` without a font-weight change.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/timeline` at 390x844 showed header label `Cadence`, row column gap `4px`, no horizontal overflow, and no warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA was visual/read-only. Status actions were not clicked to avoid mutating the user's live occurrence history.

### Sidebar rail specification

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Applied the requested desktop sidebar rail contract in `components/layout/AppShell.tsx`: expanded width is 16rem, collapsed width is 4rem, main content uses matching `lg:pl-64` or `lg:pl-16`, and width/padding transitions run over 200ms.
- Added `sidebar-open` localStorage persistence for the desktop rail, defaulting to open on desktop when no saved preference exists.
- Rebuilt the desktop header around a stable `grid-cols-[4rem_1fr]` layout, with a logo toggle, collapsed hover crossfade to `PanelLeftOpen`, and an expanded right-side `PanelLeftClose` button.
- Reworked primary nav and footer account rows around a fixed 64px icon/avatar column, 40px nav rows, 16px icons, opacity-collapsed labels, row hover when expanded, and icon-cell hover/active treatment when collapsed.
- Replaced mobile sidebar behavior with a separate sticky 64px mobile header plus 60vw drawer, z-70 backdrop, z-80 drawer, Escape close, backdrop close, focus trapping, body scroll lock, edge swipe open, and left swipe close.
- Passed the authenticated profile name/email into the shell footer account trigger from the protected app layout.
- Added Tailwind token aliases for `card`, `muted-foreground`, and `ring`, updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and refreshed design-system navigation preview/usage metadata.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test` (19 files, 110 tests).

- Pass: design-system-bench inventory scan to `/tmp/cadence-design-system.manifest.json`, usage scan to `design-system.usage.json`, and traceability verification.
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: unauthenticated in-app browser correctly redirected protected `/timeline` to `/login?next=%2Ftimeline`.
- Browser QA: local `/design-system` desktop shell preview at 1280px measured 256px expanded sidebar width, 256px main left padding, 64px icon cell, 16px icons, 40px nav rows, 64px header, label opacity `1`, and no horizontal overflow.
- Browser QA: local `/design-system` mobile shell preview at 390px measured hidden desktop aside, sticky 64px mobile header, 60vw drawer width, 64px drawer header, z-80 drawer, z-70 backdrop, 200ms transform transition, closed drawer translate `-100%`, no body scroll lock while closed, and no horizontal overflow.

Remaining risk:
- The in-app browser did not have an authenticated Supabase session, so real protected app-shell interaction was not visually QA'd on `/timeline`.
- The design-system shell preview rendered the layout correctly but did not dispatch pointer-driven state changes reliably inside the contained preview, so collapse/open clicks, focus trap cycling, and swipe gestures were verified by implementation and static measurements rather than live pointer interaction.

### Desktop sidebar header divider removal

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Removed the bottom divider from the desktop sidebar header container in `components/layout/AppShell.tsx`, matching the browser comment on the collapsed Expand navigation/logo cell.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `DESIGN.md` so the navigation contract records the unruled desktop header treatment.
- No resolver, service, schema, route, or product-scope changes were made.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`

- Pass: `npm run build`
- Pass: design-system-bench classify, theme detection, inventory scan to `/tmp/cadence-design-system.manifest.json`, usage scan to `/tmp/cadence-design-system.usage.json`, and traceability verification.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/timeline` at 1132x863 measured the fixed desktop sidebar header bottom border at `0px`, desktop sidebar width at `256px`, main left padding at `256px`, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: `/timeline` at 390x844 after reload measured desktop sidebar hidden, mobile top header height `64px`, mobile top and drawer header bottom borders still `1px`, main left padding `0px`, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- The annotated browser surface blocked pointer delivery for a live collapse click, but the removed border is on the shared desktop header container used in both expanded and collapsed rail states.

### Mobile drawer header divider removal

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Removed the bottom divider from the mobile drawer Cadence header in `components/layout/AppShell.tsx`, matching the browser comment on `aside#mobile-navigation`.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `DESIGN.md` so the navigation contract records the unruled mobile drawer header treatment.
- No resolver, service, schema, route, or product-scope changes were made.

- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test` (19 files, 110 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Pass: design-system-bench classify, theme detection, inventory scan to `/tmp/cadence-design-system.manifest.json`, usage scan to `/tmp/cadence-design-system.usage.json`, and traceability verification.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/timeline` at 890x863 with the mobile drawer open measured the drawer Cadence header bottom border at `0px`, drawer width at `534px`, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated `/timeline` at 1132x863 measured the fixed desktop sidebar header bottom border still at `0px`, desktop sidebar width at `256px`, no horizontal overflow, and no browser warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- The sticky mobile top header still has its bottom divider; the browser comment targeted the open drawer header under Cadence.

### BehaviorLog status vocabulary alignment

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Renamed the legacy stored occurrence status vocabulary to `completed` / `not_completed` across code, docs, tests, UI action values, analytics/export resolvers, and design-system fixtures.
- Added Supabase migration `20260612073554_rename_occurrence_statuses_to_behaviorlog.sql` to migrate existing `occurrences.status` rows and replace the check constraint.
- Kept UI labels as Completed / Not Completed and preserved existing semantics: unresolved is not failure, Needs decision remains derived, Completed sets `completed_at`, Not Completed clears it, and resolving cancels pending reminders.
- Export JSONL, CSV, and full JSON now emit `completed` / `not_completed`.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`
- Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts`
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/status.resolver.test.ts tests/timeline.resolver.test.ts tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts tests/export.resolver.test.ts tests/occurrence.resolver.test.ts tests/reminder.resolver.test.ts tests/completion-feedback.test.ts`

- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list` showed hosted migration history aligned except for pending `20260612073554`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --dry-run` would apply only `20260612073554_rename_occurrence_statuses_to_behaviorlog.sql`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --yes` applied `20260612073554_rename_occurrence_statuses_to_behaviorlog.sql` to hosted Supabase.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list` confirmed local and hosted migration histories now match through `20260612073554`.
- Pass: hosted `db query --linked` confirmed `occurrences_status_check` allows only `unresolved`, `completed`, and `not_completed`.
- Pass: hosted `db query --linked` confirmed zero `occurrences` rows remain with legacy status values.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA was not rerun because UI-visible labels and layout treatments did not change; hidden action values and status behavior were covered by resolver/UI-adjacent tests plus build and design-system checks.

### BehaviorLog interoperability milestone 1

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added internal `occurrence_status_events` history for explicit status marks and corrections, including same-user occurrence ownership, same-user `revises_event_id` ownership, RLS, and authenticated select/insert-only grants so normal app code treats the table as append-only.
- Updated status transition planning so the resolver produces status-event semantics and the occurrence service persists the event after a status change.
- Added BehaviorLog `.behaviorlog.zip` export generation with manifest hashes, schema, README, AGENTS guidance, behavior/schedule/occurrence/status-event JSONL files, optional notes JSONL, app-specific extension fields under `app.cadence`, and synthetic medium-confidence status events for resolved legacy rows that predate status-event history.
- Added `/api/export/behaviorlog` and the Export screen download option while keeping JSONL, CSV, full JSON, and AI summary exports intact.
- Updated product, data-model, route, resolver, UI, flow, decision, README, and AGENTS docs so current-status snapshots and append-only status history are distinct.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- gen types typescript --local` regenerated `lib/db/database.types.ts` after removing only the npm wrapper banner.
- Pass: local `pg_policies` query confirmed only `SELECT` and `INSERT` RLS policies on `occurrence_status_events`.
- Pass: local `information_schema.role_table_grants` query confirmed authenticated grants only `SELECT` and `INSERT` on `occurrence_status_events`.
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/status.resolver.test.ts tests/export.resolver.test.ts`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test` (19 files, 115 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --dry-run` would apply only `20260612075036_add_occurrence_status_events.sql`; hosted database was not changed.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --yes` applied `20260612075036_add_occurrence_status_events.sql` to hosted Supabase after user authorization.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list` confirmed local and hosted migration histories now match through `20260612075036`.
- Pass: hosted `pg_policies` query confirmed only `SELECT` and `INSERT` RLS policies on `occurrence_status_events`.
- Pass: hosted `information_schema.role_table_grants` query confirmed authenticated grants only `SELECT` and `INSERT` on `occurrence_status_events`.
- Pass: hosted count query confirmed `occurrence_status_events` exists with 26 backfilled rows.
- Local render smoke: existing dev server at `http://localhost:3000` rendered `/design-system` with the BehaviorLog bundle export control and returned 200; dev logs showed no warnings or errors beyond the React DevTools info message.

Remaining risk:
- Occurrence status update and status-event insert are orchestrated by the service as separate Supabase calls; the BehaviorLog exporter synthesizes a fallback event for resolved rows without a status-event row, but a future RPC could make the write path fully atomic.

### Ticket 014: BehaviorLog import validation dry-run

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added a pure BehaviorLog import resolver that validates parsed bundle files, required file presence, manifest SHA-256 hashes, supported schema version, JSONL row parsing, required record types, cross-record references, unsupported top-level fields, status semantics, source confidence, `revises_event_id`, and dry-run conflict/skipped-record planning.
- Added explicit import-preview types plus a service wrapper that reads `.behaviorlog.zip` bytes through the ZIP utility and passes structured file contents to the resolver.
- Extended the ZIP utility to read stored and deflated ZIP entries without adding a dependency.
- Added resolver tests using a small BehaviorLog bundle generated by the existing export resolver, including happy-path import preview, hash/JSONL parse failures, local conflict detection, current-status snapshot handling without synthesized history, and unsupported-field reporting.
- Updated `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md`, and `scripts/check-resolvers.mjs` so import validation is registered as a dry-run-only resolver path.
- No routes, UI, schema changes, database writes, merge/restore behavior, destructive operations, or deduplication writes were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run test` (20 files, 120 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run build`

Remaining risk:
- This ticket exposes a service/resolver dry-run pathway only. A user-facing import screen, authenticated API route, and any future merge/write behavior remain separate future work and should require product/data-model updates before implementation.

### Ticket 015: BehaviorLog core conformance harness

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added a pinned upstream `emixd12/BehaviorLog-Bundle` reference validator snapshot from commit `d3b3850ed6cd4fb243b091ae14baeb24fdd653e9` and recorded the snapshot source/date.
- Added `scripts/behaviorlog-conformance.mjs` and `tests/behaviorlog-conformance.test.ts`; the test generates a Cadence BehaviorLog bundle through the export resolver, writes it as a temporary `.behaviorlog/` directory, runs the upstream validator snapshot, and confirms the same files remain readable by the dry-run import resolver.
- Tightened BehaviorLog import validation so unknown top-level fields in core records are validation errors while still being reported in `unsupportedFields`.
- Updated `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md` and `docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md` with the conformance harness and stricter import-validation contract.
- No schema changes, UI routes, import writes, merge/restore behavior, optional profiles, or database mutations were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-conformance.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test` (21 files, 122 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`

Remaining risk:
- The upstream BehaviorLog Bundle specification is still draft; future alignment should intentionally update `tests/fixtures/behaviorlog-reference/SNAPSHOT.md` and the vendored validator snapshot before changing conformance expectations.

### Ticket 016: BehaviorLog Level 2 CSV views

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Ticket 016 implementation is complete. The export resolver now emits optional `csv/behaviors.csv`, `csv/schedules.csv`, `csv/occurrences.csv`, and `csv/status_events.csv` BehaviorLog bundle views generated from the same normalized records as authoritative JSONL.
- CSV files are listed in `manifest.json` as optional `text/csv` files with SHA-256 hashes and null schema references.
- Tests now compare each CSV view to its JSONL source by record count and stable ID, and cover CSV escaping plus single-column JSON-string extension encoding.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/export.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-conformance.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test` (21 files, 124 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`

Remaining risk:
- No known Ticket 016 blockers. Keep CSV as optional compatibility views and do not add import writes, merge/restore behavior, user-facing import UI, or optional BehaviorLog profiles unless a later ticket explicitly changes scope.

### Ticket 017: BehaviorLog Intervention Profile export

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Ticket 017 implementation is complete. The export service now loads user-scoped reminder deliveries for exported occurrence ids and passes sanitized delivery facts into the export resolver.
- The BehaviorLog resolver now emits optional `data/interventions.jsonl` records when exported occurrences have reminder deliveries, advertises the optional `interventions` profile, adds an Intervention schema definition, and lists the file in `manifest.json` with SHA-256 hash and `required: false`.
- Intervention records reference exported behaviors and occurrences, preserve channel, scheduled send time, sent time, delivery status, and sanitized failure reason, and keep Cadence delivery metadata under `extensions.app.cadence`.
- No reminder processing behavior, provider sends, import writes, message-body export, user-facing import UI, schema migration, or notification-provider side effects were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/export.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-conformance.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts` (24 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run test` (21 files, 127 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`

Remaining risk:
- Import validation still ignores optional Intervention Profile records beyond manifest hash validation; any future intervention import or merge behavior needs a separate ticket and product/data-model update.

### Ticket 018: BehaviorLog import persistence foundation

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added Supabase migration `20260612221022_add_behaviorlog_import_tracking.sql`
  with `behaviorlog_import_runs` and
  `behaviorlog_import_record_mappings`.
- Import runs store user-owned bundle/schema metadata, manifest SHA-256,
  deterministic bundle fingerprint, producer metadata, subject/privacy hints,
  import mode, dry-run summary snapshot, status, failure message, and
  start/completion timestamps.
- Record mappings store external BehaviorLog ids to local Cadence UUIDs by
  import run and record type, with support for behavior, schedule, occurrence,
  status event, note, and intervention mappings.
- Mapping inserts are idempotent on `import_run_id, record_type, external_id`.
- Added repository and service helpers for import-run creation, status updates,
  and mapping insertion/listing. These helpers write only import tracking rows,
  not imported product records.
- Updated generated database types, domain aliases, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, and
  `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md`.
- Later Tickets 019-023 depend on this import run and external-to-local mapping
  contract.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`.
- Pass: local schema probe confirmed RLS enabled on both new tables.
- Pass: local `pg_policies` probe confirmed authenticated owner policies for
  select, insert, update, and delete on both new tables. The first probe without
  `roles::text` hit a Supabase CLI scan limitation for `name[]`, then passed
  with the cast.
- Pass: local grant probe confirmed no `anon` grants and explicit
  authenticated/service-role CRUD grants on both new tables.
- Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts`.
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts`.
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck` after regenerating types with the direct Supabase
  binary; the npm script wrapper prints a banner that must not be redirected
  into `lib/db/database.types.ts`.

Remaining risk:
- Hosted Supabase now has migration
  `20260612221022_add_behaviorlog_import_tracking.sql`; `npm run supabase --
  db push --linked --yes` and `npm run supabase -- migration list --linked`
  passed on 2026-06-14.
- The tracking layer intentionally does not create, merge, overwrite, restore,
  delete, or deduplicate imported product records. Ticket 019 starts the first
  constrained product-record write path.

### Ticket 019: BehaviorLog create-only core import

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added `applyCreateMissingBehaviorLogImportPlan` in
  `lib/services/behaviorlog-import-write.service.ts`.
- The create-only apply path requires an existing valid dry-run import run with
  `import_mode = 'create_missing_only'` and an accepted valid dry-run summary.
- Creates clearly new behaviors, compatible schedule slots, and occurrences
  from authoritative BehaviorLog JSONL plan records.
- Inserts imported occurrences as `unresolved` first, appends imported
  `occurrence_status_events`, then updates occurrence `status`, `completed_at`,
  and `status_marked_at` from the latest imported status event for each
  occurrence.
- Does not synthesize status history from
  `occurrences.jsonl.current_status`; resolved snapshots without supporting
  status events remain warnings and imported occurrences stay unresolved.
- Uses `behaviorlog_import_record_mappings` for external-to-local behavior,
  schedule, occurrence, and status-event id mappings and for same-run
  idempotence.
- Added narrow repository helpers for import run lookup, schedule-slot
  create/lookup, occurrence create/lookup, and imported status-event duplicate
  fingerprint lookup.
- Extended the import resolver/types to preserve Cadence extension fields and
  warn/skip unsupported recurrence profiles, unsupported recurrence payloads,
  and unsupported schedule windows.
- Updated `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md`, and
  `docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md` for create-only import semantics.
- No notes, interventions, CSV-only data, merge behavior, overwrite/restore,
  destructive delete, user-facing import UI, or provider side effects were
  added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts` (12 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.

Remaining risk:
- Hosted Supabase now has the Ticket 018 import-tracking migration; `npm run
  supabase -- migration list --linked` shows local and remote
  `20260612221022` match.
- Ticket 020 should treat the create-only path as provenance-aware but not
  conflict-resolving. Merge preview must make mapping/map-to-existing decisions
  explicit instead of relying on the create-only writer.
- Ticket 022 remains responsible for occurrence-note import decisions; Ticket
  019 intentionally does not import notes.
- Ticket 023 remains preview-only for interventions; Ticket 019 intentionally
  does not write `reminder_deliveries`.

### Ticket 020: BehaviorLog conflict-aware merge preview

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added `resolveBehaviorLogImportMergePreview` with deterministic
  `create_new`, `map_to_existing`, `skip_existing`, and
  `conflict_requires_decision` actions.
- Added stable merge conflict codes and human-readable reasons for behavior,
  schedule, occurrence, status-event, note, and intervention preview records.
- Added merge-preview privacy/redaction summary and explicit BehaviorLog
  semantics flags for JSONL authority, CSV ignored for merge, status-events
  authority, unresolved-not-failure, and append-only status history.
- Extended existing-record inputs with schedules, import mappings,
  source-original ids, archive state, schedule shape, status-event semantics,
  and revision target fields used by merge preview.
- Added optional notes and interventions to merge preview only. No note writes,
  intervention writes, reminder delivery writes, provider calls, or reminder
  scheduling side effects were added.
- Added service helpers for merge preview from files/ZIP and an import-run
  persistence helper that stores the merge preview snapshot in
  `behaviorlog_import_runs.dry_run_summary` only.
- Preserved the Ticket 019 create-only `plan.action` contract and writer path.
- Updated `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md`, and
  `docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md`.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-merge-preview.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts` (17 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run build` after rerunning with approved network access; the first
  sandboxed build failed because Next.js could not fetch the configured Google
  Font.

Remaining risk:
- Hosted Supabase now has the Ticket 018 import-tracking migration; `npm run
  supabase -- migration list --linked` shows local and remote
  `20260612221022` match.
- Ticket 021 should consume `preview.mergePreview.actions` and
  `dry_run_summary.mergePreview`, refuse unresolved
  `conflict_requires_decision` actions, and still avoid blind overwrite or
  destructive restore behavior.
- Ticket 022 remains responsible for note import decisions; Ticket 020 only
  previews notes.
- Ticket 023 remains responsible for detailed intervention validation; Ticket
  020 only previews interventions and does not write `reminder_deliveries`.

### Ticket 021: BehaviorLog user-approved merge write

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added `applyApprovedBehaviorLogMergePlan` in
  `lib/services/behaviorlog-import-write.service.ts`.
- The merge writer requires an import run with
  `import_mode = 'merge_by_user_approved_plan'`, a valid accepted
  `dry_run_summary.mergePreview`, and a matching input merge preview.
- Refuses to apply unresolved `conflict_requires_decision` actions and marks the
  import run failed on apply errors.
- Applies `create_new` records using the Ticket 019 create-only safeguards.
- Applies `map_to_existing` for behaviors, schedules, and occurrences by writing
  provenance mappings only; it does not overwrite local behavior, schedule, or
  occurrence fields.
- Appends imported status events that are not already mapped or duplicated,
  preserves `revises_event_id` when the revised event is mapped, and records all
  applied mappings.
- Updates occurrence current-status snapshots only after imported status events
  are accepted, and only when the imported event is the latest by effective
  time, recorded time, then stable id.
- Protects existing local explicit high-confidence status snapshots from
  ambiguous or lower-confidence imported events.
- Added `getBehaviorScheduleSlotById` repository helper and merge-write tests.
- Notes remain non-product writes in this phase; mappings may be recorded but
  occurrence note fill/conflict logic is left for Ticket 022.
- Interventions remain preview/provenance-only; no `reminder_deliveries`,
  provider calls, or scheduling side effects were added.
- Updated `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md`, and
  `docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md`.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-merge-preview.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts` (22 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run build`.

Remaining risk:
- Hosted Supabase now has the Ticket 018 import-tracking migration; `npm run
  supabase -- migration list --linked` shows local and remote
  `20260612221022` match.
- Merge apply remains a multi-call Supabase workflow. A partial failure marks
  the import run `failed`, but already-written rows are not rolled back. This
  matches the Ticket 019 service pattern and should be revisited if the import
  UI later needs stronger atomicity.
- Ticket 022 should implement occurrence-note import/fill/conflict behavior on
  top of the existing note preview/provenance scaffolding.
- Ticket 023 should keep interventions preview-only unless a later data model
  adds passive imported intervention history.

### Ticket 022: BehaviorLog optional notes import

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added limited BehaviorLog note import support for occurrence-attached notes
  only.
- Parsed `data/notes.jsonl` sensitivity labels and source metadata into the
  import plan and merge-preview metadata.
- Added preview warnings for high and restricted sensitivity notes.
- Skipped behavior-attached, status-event-attached, review-attached, and
  AI-generated notes from product data with explicit warnings/reasons.
- Added safe merge-preview note decisions for created occurrence fill, empty
  mapped occurrence fill, already-matching mapped notes, missing targets, and
  differing existing-note conflicts.
- Added approved merge-apply support that fills `occurrences.note` only when
  the target occurrence is safely identified and the local note is still empty.
  Note mappings use the target occurrence id as `local_id`.
- Existing non-empty differing occurrence notes remain protected behind
  `occurrence_note_conflict`; note replacement was not added.
- Notes do not update occurrence status fields, status-event history, reminder
  deliveries, analytics inputs, adherence logic, provider calls, or scheduling.
- No generalized notes table was added.
- Updated `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md`,
  `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md`.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-notes.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-merge-preview.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts` (30 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- Hosted Supabase now has the Ticket 018 import-tracking migration; `npm run
  supabase -- migration list --linked` shows local and remote
  `20260612221022` match.
- Ticket 023 should keep Intervention Profile import preview-only. It must not
  write `reminder_deliveries`, call providers, send notifications, schedule
  reminders, or reuse occurrence-note fill behavior for interventions.

### Ticket 023: BehaviorLog Intervention Profile import preview

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added optional `data/interventions.jsonl` parsing to BehaviorLog import
  preview.
- Intervention rows validate JSONL parsing, manifest hash, `record_type`,
  channel, delivery status, and behavior/occurrence references.
- Intervention preview plans are marked `action: "preview_only"` and
  `previewOnly: true`.
- Import summary now includes intervention count, preview-only count, and
  counts by channel, delivery status, and linked behavior.
- Merge preview includes intervention rows only as preview/provenance actions;
  it does not schedule, send, cancel, retry, or write operational reminders.
- Added warnings for sensitive delivery payload fields and values, including
  message bodies, endpoints, provider identifiers/secrets, subscription keys,
  recipient identifiers, emails, phones, and similar nested extension fields.
- Updated `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md`, `docs/NOTIFICATION_SPEC.md`, and
  `docs/AGENT_RESOLVERS.md`.
- No schema changes, `reminder_deliveries` writes, provider calls,
  notification-processing route calls, or `csv/interventions.csv` output were
  added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-interventions.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-notes.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-merge-preview.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts` (36 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (25 files, 157 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `env HOME=/private/tmp/cadence-supabase-home npm run supabase -- db reset`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes` applied
  `20260612221022_add_behaviorlog_import_tracking.sql` to hosted Supabase on
  2026-06-14.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list --linked` shows local and remote
  `20260612221022` match.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- Hosted Supabase now has the Ticket 018 import-tracking migration.
- Imported intervention records are intentionally not stored as passive history.
  A later ticket would need a separate data model before retaining imported
  intervention history outside the preview/import ledger.

### Ticket 024: User-facing BehaviorLog import UI

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added a first-class BehaviorLog import section to the authenticated Export
  screen. It accepts `.behaviorlog.zip` uploads, rejects unsupported files,
  persists preview import-run ledger rows, shows dry-run counts, errors,
  warnings, conflicts, privacy notes, note sensitivity warnings, intervention
  preview counts, and merge actions, and requires explicit confirmation before
  create-only or approved-merge writes.
- Added server actions and a UI-facing import service layer that regenerates
  previews from the submitted bundle payload during apply, gathers current local
  records for conflict-aware merge preview, and creates a mode-specific import
  run before calling the existing create-only or approved-merge writers.
- Added recent import-run history to the Export screen with mode, status,
  timestamps, and failure message display.
- Added repository reads for recent import runs, user import mappings, and all
  user occurrences. No schema changes were needed.
- Updated the design-system bench inventory/usage and added a live preview for
  the new import panel.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, `docs/ROUTE_MAP.md`, and
  `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md` for the user-facing import workflow.
- No destructive restore/overwrite behavior, generalized notes data model,
  intervention-to-reminder writes, provider calls, or raw bundle persistence
  were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-ui.test.tsx`.
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-ui.test.tsx tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-merge-preview.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts` (31 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (26 files, 163 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: browser QA on existing local dev server at `http://localhost:3000/export`
  for desktop and 390px mobile viewport; Import, upload control, recent runs,
  and downloads rendered with no horizontal overflow.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- Apply uses the submitted bundle payload to regenerate preview server-side; raw
  bundle contents are intentionally not stored in Postgres. Very large bundles
  remain capped by the current upload screen limit and may need a separate
  storage-backed handoff if future import sizes grow.
- The import UI depends on the existing Ticket 019-023 writer semantics; partial
  apply failures still mark the import run failed but do not roll back already
  written rows.

### Ticket 026: General BehaviorLog notes data model and import

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added the user-owned `imported_notes` table for passive BehaviorLog notes
  attached to behaviors, occurrences, status events, and reviews, with
  owner-scoped RLS, source metadata, source original id, sensitivity, role,
  imported timestamps, attachment target, and import-run provenance.
- Extended BehaviorLog import preview and apply so non-AI notes can be stored as
  imported note records while occurrence-attached notes may also fill the
  existing occurrence Note field only when the target is safe and the local note
  is empty.
- Changed note mappings to point at `imported_notes.id` instead of an occurrence
  id, and included existing imported notes in merge-preview context for
  idempotent mapping.
- Updated the Export import panel to distinguish imported note records from
  inline occurrence-note fills and to require a dedicated high/restricted note
  sensitivity acknowledgement before apply. The server enforces the
  acknowledgement as well as the UI.
- Updated product, data-model, export/import, UI, user-flow, resolver registry,
  and design docs so notes remain passive user-review context and do not feed
  status, adherence, reminders, or analytics.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-notes.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-merge-preview.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-ui.test.tsx tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts` (35 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`.
- Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --dry-run`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes` applied
  `20260618120000_add_imported_notes.sql` to hosted Supabase.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list --linked` confirmed
  `20260618120000` is present locally and remotely.
- Pass: hosted schema probe confirmed `public.imported_notes` has RLS enabled
  with four policies.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (26 files, 169 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Browser QA: started Cadence on `http://localhost:3003` because port 3000 was
  serving a different local app; authenticated `/export` rendered at desktop
  and 390px mobile with the import section present, no horizontal overflow, and
  no browser warning/error logs. `/design-system#ds-module-behaviorlog-import`
  rendered the idle import panel without overflow or warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: uploaded
  `/tmp/cadence-ticket-26-upload-20260618064102.behaviorlog.zip` through the
  Export import form and received `BehaviorLog preview ready.` with dry-run
  counts, `Imported note records`, `Inline note fills`,
  `high_sensitivity_note_present`, the note sensitivity warning, and the
  high/restricted note acknowledgement visible. The post-upload preview had no
  horizontal overflow at 1280px or 390px and no browser warning/error events.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA stopped at preview and did not click Apply, so no product records
  were accepted from the browser upload. The apply path remains covered by
  resolver, service, and render tests.

### Ticket 027: Imported intervention history storage

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added user-owned passive `imported_interventions` storage with owner-scoped
  RLS, import-run ownership, optional local behavior/occurrence links, external
  BehaviorLog ids, intervention type, channel, delivery status,
  scheduled/sent timestamps, sanitized failure reason, source metadata,
  redaction indicators, and metadata.
- Extended BehaviorLog intervention preview so each intervention shows passive
  storage fields, dropped sensitive delivery fields, redacted fields, and
  explicit no-reminder/no-provider side-effect flags.
- Extended create-only and approved-merge apply paths to store passive
  intervention history idempotently through `behaviorlog_import_record_mappings`
  with `record_type = 'intervention'`.
- Updated the Export import panel to show imported intervention counts,
  passive-history rows, dropped/redacted field counts, per-intervention storage
  details, and applied imported-intervention counts.
- Updated data model, notification, export/import, UI, user-flow, and resolver
  registry docs. No Ticket 028 promotion behavior, `reminder_deliveries` writes,
  provider calls, scheduling, sending, cancellation, retry, or claim behavior
  was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`.
- Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts`.
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-intervention-history.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-interventions.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-merge-preview.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts` (31 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-intervention-history.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-interventions.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-merge-preview.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-ui.test.tsx tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-notes.test.ts` (51 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (27 files, 173 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: local schema probe confirmed RLS enabled on
  `public.imported_interventions` with select/insert/update/delete owner
  policies. The first probe hit the Supabase CLI array scan limitation and
  passed after casting the policy list to text.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes` applied
  `20260618220226_add_imported_intervention_history.sql` to hosted Supabase on
  2026-06-18.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list --linked` confirmed
  `20260618220226` is present locally and remotely.

Remaining risk:
- No known Ticket 027 blockers.

### Ticket 028: Promote imported interventions into reminder deliveries

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added nullable `reminder_deliveries.import_run_id` and
  `reminder_deliveries.imported_intervention_id` provenance columns with a
  pair check, same-user foreign keys, and a unique imported-intervention index.
- Added `lib/resolvers/imported-intervention-promotion.resolver.ts` to
  classify selected passive intervention rows and return operational reminder
  delivery plans only when the user selected rows, confirmed promotion, the row
  is a future pending reminder, the linked behavior/occurrence are current and
  owned by the user, the occurrence is unresolved, the behavior is active, the
  channel is enabled, and the scheduled send time matches current
  `resolveReminderDeliveries` output.
- Added `lib/services/imported-intervention-promotion.service.ts` to orchestrate
  user-scoped reads, existing-delivery checks, idempotent reminder-delivery
  insertion, and provenance attachment. Promotion does not call Sequenzy, Web
  Push, browser APIs, provider SDKs, or notification processing routes.
- Extended `importedInterventions.repo` and `reminderDeliveries.repo` with
  selected-row reads and pending-delivery provenance attachment.
- Added focused Ticket 028 coverage in
  `tests/imported-intervention-promotion.test.ts` for eligibility filtering,
  explicit selection/confirmation, duplicate selected records, existing
  delivery handling, provenance, historical/resolved-occurrence rejection, UTC
  timestamp normalization, and the migration contract.
- Updated data-model, notification, export/import, user-flow, and resolver
  registry docs so BehaviorLog import apply remains passive while promotion is
  a separate opt-in service-level workflow. No Export-screen promotion UI was
  added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration new add_imported_intervention_promotion_provenance`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`.
- Pass: `./node_modules/.bin/supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/db/database.types.ts`.
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/imported-intervention-promotion.test.ts` (22 focused tests).
- Pass: targeted ESLint for the new resolver, service, repository helpers,
  test, and resolver-check script.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (28 files, 195 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: local Supabase schema probes confirmed nullable
  `reminder_deliveries.import_run_id` and `imported_intervention_id` columns
  plus the promotion pair check and same-user foreign-key constraints.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes` applied
  `20260618222427_add_imported_intervention_promotion_provenance.sql` to hosted
  Supabase on 2026-06-18.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- migration list --linked` confirmed
  `20260618222427` is present locally and remotely.

Remaining risk:
- The promotion workflow is implemented as a service-level contract. A
  user-facing review/confirmation UI or API route still needs a separate scoped
  ticket before users can invoke it from the app.

### Ticket 029: Public web hardening account safety baseline

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Verified production reminder cron execution through Vercel runtime logs
  without manually triggering a send. Hourly production
  `GET /api/reminders/process` requests returned 200 from
  2026-06-18T01:00:03Z through 2026-06-19T00:00:03Z, with no production
  warning, error, or fatal logs in the previous seven days.
- Added public `/terms`, `/privacy`, and `/trust` routes with sparse account,
  privacy, portability, manual-status, and reminder-boundary copy.
- Linked Terms, Privacy, and Trust from Login and Settings.
- Added Settings account deletion with export acknowledgement and typed
  confirmation. The server action signs out globally, then deletes the current
  Supabase auth user through the server-only service-role client so existing
  `on delete cascade` ownership constraints remove hosted Cadence records.
- Added in-memory auth-failure rate limiting for `/api/push/subscribe` and
  `/api/reminders/process`.
- Bounded `/api/reminders/process?limit=` to a maximum batch size of 100.
- Added malformed UUID validation for occurrence status/note mutations before
  repository lookup.
- Added a static RLS policy registry test covering every user-owned public
  table in the migration set.
- Updated product, data-model, notification, route, UI, user-flow, operations,
  Vercel workflow, ticket, and design docs.
- No schema migration, Ticket 025A/025B restore work, marketing site,
  workspace restructuring, billing, AI, desktop/mobile, PWA/offline, provider
  sends, or admin/support surface was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/account-deletion.service.test.ts tests/push-subscribe-route.test.ts tests/reminder-process-route.test.ts tests/legal-content.test.tsx tests/rls-policy-registry.test.ts` (19 focused tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (31 files, 206 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Vercel tool verification: production project `cadence`
  (`prj_9tZKRXZ6IdT56ZLKVSmoJH5AAYhs`) latest deployment
  `dpl_APxAZ7fDhZjuNHvKFPMgZjMTP3eK` is `READY` at commit
  `e1bf0bfa56b00264b88ce3cb4307fc6c62823a3b`; reminder cron logs returned 200
  hourly as noted above.
- Browser QA: attempted Playwright against local dev server. The bundled
  Playwright browser was not installed, system Chrome failed to launch headless
  in this environment, and the local Next dev server had a stale lock reporting
  PID 49560 while no HTTP connection was available on port 3000. UI route
  rendering is covered by `npm run build` and render-level tests, but live
  desktop/mobile browser inspection remains unverified in this pass.

Remaining risk:
- Browser push subscription verification from Ticket 029 was superseded by the
  Browser push delivery troubleshooting note below: production Chrome now shows
  permission granted and an active PushSubscription. Real provider delivery
  still needs deployed-code verification.
- The latest production deployment became ready after the observed 00:00Z cron
  tick; confirm the next post-deploy hourly cron tick if strict latest-artifact
  cron verification is needed.
- The rate limiter is per-runtime in-memory protection. It is a practical
  baseline, not distributed abuse prevention across all Vercel instances.
- First-run onboarding, privacy-safe monitoring, and many-user RLS smoke QA were
  completed in Ticket 030 below.

### Ticket 030: Public web hardening follow-up

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Made the future public web hardening follow-up explicit as Ticket 030 in
  `docs/TICKETS.md`.
- Added a server-derived, client-aware first-run setup panel on Timeline. It
  appears only while required setup remains incomplete and the user has not
  dismissed it in the current browser.
- The setup panel links to existing controls:
  `/behaviors#create-behavior`, `/settings#notifications`,
  `/settings#timezone`, and `/export#behaviorlog-import`. Import remains
  optional and non-blocking.
- Added anchor targets to the existing Behavior create, Settings notification,
  Settings timezone, and BehaviorLog import sections.
- Added privacy-safe structured monitoring helpers and wired OAuth callback,
  push subscription, and reminder processing route outcomes into sanitized
  runtime logs. No external monitoring SDK or third-party reporting provider was
  added.
- Added `npm run smoke:rls` backed by `scripts/supabase-rls-smoke.mjs`. The
  smoke command creates two temporary auth users with service-role access for
  setup/cleanup, then signs in with ordinary publishable-key clients and checks
  profile/category/behavior isolation.
- Updated product, UI, user-flow, route, notification, data-model, operations,
  Supabase, Vercel, design, ticket, and status docs.
- No schema migration, new product route, provider send, marketing site,
  admin/support dashboard, analytics/cookie SDK, workspace restructuring, or
  offline/PWA behavior was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/onboarding.service.test.ts tests/monitoring.test.ts tests/rls-smoke-script.test.ts` (14 focused tests).
- Pass: targeted ESLint for changed onboarding, monitoring, route, and test
  files.
- Pass: `npm run smoke:rls`; configured Supabase target created two temporary
  users, verified six ownership checks, and cleaned up temporary users.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (35 files, 241 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Browser QA: local dev server at `http://localhost:3000` with a temporary
  authenticated Chrome user rendered `/timeline` first-run setup at 1280px and
  390px. The setup links were present, there was no horizontal overflow, no
  console warnings/errors were captured, the mobile fixed Needs decision
  control sat over reserved blank panel space, and the temporary auth user was
  cleaned up.

Remaining risk:
- The monitoring implementation intentionally uses platform runtime logs only.
  If a later ticket adds a third-party monitoring provider, it needs an
  explicit privacy model and consent posture before sending events off-platform.
- `npm run smoke:rls` should be rerun before broad public launch and after
  material RLS/schema changes.

### Browser push delivery troubleshooting

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Investigated the reported Chrome notification prompt issue from Settings.
  Chrome on production `https://cadence-blush-three.vercel.app/settings`
  already reports `Notification.permission = "granted"`, so clicking Save
  subscription will not show a browser authorization prompt for that origin
  unless the site permission is reset.
- Confirmed the production Chrome profile has one service worker registration
  for the app origin and an active PushSubscription through `fcm.googleapis.com`
  with both `p256dh` and `auth` keys present. The subscription step is therefore
  working in Chrome.
- Fixed the actual delivery gap: `/api/reminders/process` now calls combined
  reminder processing instead of the email-only processor.
- Added `web-push` server-side sending through `lib/services/web-push.service.ts`
  using `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` plus server-only `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Added browser-push due delivery listing/claiming, active subscription lookup,
  expired subscription deactivation, no-subscription failure logging, and
  missing-VAPID failure logging.
- Kept resolver logic pure; browser provider calls remain in services.
- Updated the Settings notification panel so the Permission row continues to
  show Chrome's real permission state (`Allowed`, `Blocked`, or `Not enabled`)
  after saving a subscription instead of replacing it with `Enabled`.
- Updated notification, route, Vercel workflow, and status docs.
- No schema migration, PWA caching, offline writes, marketing flow, or extra
  Settings surface was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/reminder.service.test.ts tests/reminder-process-route.test.ts tests/push-subscribe-route.test.ts tests/push-browser.test.ts` (4 files, 26 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (31 files, 212 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: local Astro dev server HTTP smoke for `/`, `/docs`, `/llms.txt`, and
  `/examples/cadence-demo.behaviorlog.zip` at `http://127.0.0.1:4321/`.
- NPM install for `web-push` / `@types/web-push` completed with the existing
  `ink` React peer warning and 0 vulnerabilities.
- Chrome QA: local `http://localhost:3000/login?next=%2Fsettings` reported
  secure context, Notification API available, `Notification.permission =
  "default"`, service worker support available, and PushManager available.
- Chrome QA: production Settings tab reported secure context, Notification API
  available, `Notification.permission = "granted"`, service worker support
  available, PushManager available, one app service worker registration, and an
  active FCM PushSubscription with required keys present. Endpoint and keys were
  not printed.

Remaining risk:
- A real browser-push provider send was not triggered during this troubleshooting
  pass. The new provider path is covered by mocked service tests; deployed
  production verification still needs this code deployed and a safe due browser
  reminder or approved test-send path.
- If the user wants to see Chrome's browser authorization prompt again on the
  production origin, the existing allowed notification permission must be reset
  in Chrome site settings first.

### Browser push production verification

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Fixed reminder processor revalidation so expected reminder timestamps are
  compared as Temporal instants instead of raw strings. Supabase/Postgres can
  return the same UTC instant as `+00:00` while the resolver emits `Z`; those
  now match for both email and browser-push deliveries.
- Updated the Settings notification control so Save subscription remains the
  stable action label, retries `Notification.requestPermission()` from the
  user click whenever Chrome still allows prompting, and stays clickable in the
  blocked state so it can show factual unblock guidance.
- Updated notification, UI, and user-flow docs for click-driven permission
  retry and the browser limitation that already allowed or blocked origins do
  not show the native prompt again until site settings are reset.
- Deployed the isolated browser-push fix to the existing Vercel production
  project from a temporary clean copy so unrelated in-progress local changes
  were not included. Deployment `dpl_B5RBr2msxy29hnEHijAXjdf1iFdH` became
  READY and was aliased to `https://cadence-blush-three.vercel.app`.
- No schema migration, offline/PWA caching, marketing flow, or new Settings
  surface was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/reminder.service.test.ts tests/push-browser.test.ts` (2 files, 18 tests).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (32 files, 219 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Production preflight: due email reminder count was 0 before calling the
  processor; active browser subscriptions existed for Apple Push and Chrome
  FCM.
- Production send QA: inserted one temporary Chrome-targeted browser-push
  behavior/occurrence/reminder due at `2020-01-01T15:00:00Z`, called
  `POST https://cadence-blush-three.vercel.app/api/reminders/process?limit=1`,
  and received `{ checked: 1, claimed: 1, sent: 1, failed: 0, cancelled: 0 }`.
  The delivery row was marked `sent` with `sent_at`, no error, and
  `processing_started_at`.
- Production cleanup QA: deleted the temporary behavior and confirmed 0
  matching QA behaviors and 0 matching QA reminder-delivery rows remained.
- Chrome QA: production Settings rendered `Allowed`, `Available`, and Save
  subscription; Chrome DevTools Protocol reported secure context, Notification
  API, service worker, PushManager, `Notification.permission = "granted"`, and
  an active FCM PushSubscription with both required keys present.

Remaining risk:
- Chrome will not show the native notification permission banner again for an
  origin that is already `granted` or `denied`. The production Chrome profile
  is currently `granted`, so seeing the banner again requires manually resetting
  the Cadence site permission to the ask/default state in Chrome site settings,
  then clicking Save subscription.
- Codex browser automation was not allowed to open `chrome://settings`, so the
  permission reset itself was not performed by the agent.

### Public product posture

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated Cadence's source-of-truth posture from private-only personal app to
  public, open-source, single-account personal behavior tracker.
- Added `docs/PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md` to scope the target surface model:
  authenticated web app, Astro marketing site, future Tauri desktop app, future
  mobile app, and eventual shared packages.
- Documented the launch sequence: harden the current Google-auth web app for
  many independent accounts first; defer billing, AI speech features,
  desktop/mobile implementation, and workspace restructuring until explicit
  tickets.
- Added future tickets for public web hardening, Astro marketing, and workspace
  restructuring.
- Updated product, route, UI, flow, data, notification, export, operations,
  Vercel, desktop proposal, README, AGENTS, and decision docs to reflect the
  public posture and BehaviorLog Bundle demonstration/adoption role.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`

Remaining risk:
- No implementation restructure was performed. Current routes, deployment
  assumptions, package layout, and app code remain unchanged until future
  tickets schedule the work.

### Settings timezone detection and override

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added a lightweight Settings timezone panel that shows the stored profile
  timezone, detects the browser/OS timezone with `Intl.DateTimeFormat()`, offers
  a Use detected timezone action, and supports manual IANA timezone entry.
- Added server-side timezone canonicalization/validation without geolocation or
  location permission.
- Saving a changed timezone updates `profiles.timezone`, updates all active
  behaviors to that timezone, and resyncs future unresolved occurrences through
  the existing occurrence generation service. Past occurrences, resolved
  occurrences, and archived behaviors remain historical records.
- Added repository helpers for profile timezone and active behavior timezone
  updates, plus service tests for validation, no-op saves, and active-behavior
  resync orchestration.
- Updated date/time, data-model, product, UI, user-flow, route, ticket, design,
  and status docs to reflect the implemented policy.
- No schema migration, location permission prompt, onboarding wizard, or
  out-of-scope app surface was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/settings.service.test.ts`
- Pass: targeted ESLint for changed Settings/service/repository/test files.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run test` (32 files, 219 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Pass: `git diff --check`
- Browser QA: authenticated Chrome `/settings` rendered the new full-width
  Timezone panel with Current timezone, Browser timezone, IANA timezone field,
  Use detected timezone, and Save timezone controls. Browser timezone matched
  the saved timezone, so Use detected timezone was disabled as expected.
- Browser QA: a no-op Save timezone submit against the current timezone
  returned `POST /settings 200` and did not mutate behavior schedules.
- Browser QA: headless system Chrome verified unauthenticated `/settings`
  redirects to `/login?next=%2Fsettings` at 1280px and 390px with no horizontal
  overflow and no console warnings/errors.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA intentionally did not change the real account timezone; the changed
  timezone mutation/resync path is covered by mocked service tests.
- Protected mobile Settings visual inspection could not be completed reliably
  with the available desktop-browser automation. The unauthenticated mobile
  redirect/login surface was verified at 390px.

### Behavior create submit feedback

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added a client-owned Behaviors create disclosure wrapper so successful create
  submissions close the create form instead of leaving it open.
- Kept the existing server action success text, `Behavior created.`, and moved
  create success feedback outside the collapsible form so the message remains
  visible after the form closes.
- Remounted the create form after success so a later create starts from blank
  default fields.
- Added the new create-section module to the design-system manifest, usage map,
  and dev-only bench preview.
- No schema, resolver, reminder, export, analytics, route, or product-scope
  changes were added.

Verification:
- Pass: targeted ESLint for changed Behaviors and design-system files.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`
- Pass: `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/verify_traceability.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --usage design-system.usage.json --bench app/design-system/page.tsx`
- Pass: `git diff --check`
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`
- Pass: `npm run lint`
- Pass: `npm run test` (32 files, 227 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`
- Browser QA: headless system Chrome submitted the dev-only
  `BehaviorCreateSection` preview at `/design-system`; after the successful
  bench server action, the disclosure was closed, the success status remained
  visible, the title field was blank after remount, and desktop plus 390px
  mobile viewports had no horizontal overflow.

Remaining risk:
- The authenticated `/behaviors` production-data create path was not submitted
  during this pass; the wrapper behavior was verified through the same component
  in the dev-only bench with a harmless server action, and the real create
  action already returns `Behavior created.`.

### Ticket 031: Astro marketing site

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added `apps/marketing` as a sibling Astro app without moving or changing the
  authenticated Next.js app shell.
- Implemented `/`, `/standard`, `/cadence`, `/examples`, `/docs`, and `/about`.
  The homepage leads with BehaviorLog as the standard, while Cadence remains
  the main product object and demonstration tracker.
- Kept the current Cadence mark, added a quieter inline BehaviorLog companion
  mark, and reused the square ledger visual system with sanitized static
  Timeline and bundle captures.
- Added primary CTAs for Try Cadence, Read the Standard, Download Example
  Bundle, and View on GitHub.
- Added SEO and agent-readability outputs: canonical metadata, Open
  Graph/Twitter metadata, JSON-LD, Markdown alternate links, `sitemap.xml`,
  `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, page `.md` mirrors, and
  `/data/route-manifest.json`.
- Added a build-time generator for a sanitized example
  `cadence-demo.behaviorlog.zip` bundle and a marketing agent-readability
  verification script.
- Added npm workspace scripts for `marketing:dev`, `marketing:build`,
  `marketing:check`, and `marketing:preview`; root Next scripts remain
  unchanged.
- Ran a post-launch impeccable polish pass on the marketing site: fixed the
  CSS font reset that caused browser-serif rendering, contained mobile table
  and code-panel overflow, made the sticky header solid, added semantic inline
  code styling, improved mobile tap-target text sizing, and adjusted the
  homepage hero/capture layout so it does not collide or clip.
- Recorded the max-visibility marketing crawl policy in
  `docs/CRAWL_POLICY.md`.
- Updated public product architecture, route map, product/UI/user-flow docs,
  future-update notes, operations, design docs, tickets, and this status ledger.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run marketing:build`.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check`.
- Pass: `unzip -t apps/marketing/public/examples/cadence-demo.behaviorlog.zip`.
- Pass: `node tests/fixtures/behaviorlog-reference/validate.mjs /private/tmp/cadence-demo-bundle-check-current`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (39 files, 251 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: Chrome DevTools screenshot QA for `/` and `/docs` at a true 390px
  mobile viewport; both routes reported `docScrollWidth === docClientWidth`.
- Pass: Chrome DevTools screenshot QA for `/` at 1440px desktop; the hero
  product capture stayed inside the viewport and did not collide with the H1.
- Pass: local agent-readability audit against `http://127.0.0.1:4321` returned
  13 pass, 1 warn, 0 fail; the warning is uniform sitemap `lastmod` values,
  expected because all marketing routes launched on 2026-06-20.
- Pass: Vercel production deployment `dpl_3nZNis38DwHLQDndxyG37URrwRk4`
  reached `READY` for the separate `cadence-marketing` project and was aliased
  to `https://cadence-marketing-two.vercel.app`.
- Pass: live Vercel fetch checks returned 200 for `/`, `/docs`,
  `/sitemap.xml`, and `/llms.txt`; canonical and sitemap URLs point at
  `https://cadence-marketing-two.vercel.app`.

Remaining risk:
- A custom apex/domain is not configured yet. If the marketing site later owns
  apex `/`, keep the authenticated app entry behavior through an app subdomain
  or app-specific route.

### Codebase documentation refresh

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Reviewed the implemented app, marketing workspace, migrations, resolver
  registry, tests, and source-of-truth docs for current-state drift.
- Updated bootstrap/governance/deployment docs so they describe the implemented
  authenticated Next.js app plus sibling Astro marketing site, not a future
  marketing site.
- Updated resolver registry text for the implemented BehaviorLog restore
  preview/apply UI and service test coverage.
- Updated ticket verification guidance to include the agent and resolver drift
  checks before the standard lint/typecheck/test/build sequence.
- No product code, schema, route, provider, or scope changes were made.

Verification:
- Pass: stale documentation scan for old marketing/future-surface wording.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (39 files, 251 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

### Occurrence decision correction implementation

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Implemented Ticket 032 Needs Decision same-day correction retention.
- Timeline resolver input now carries `statusMarkedAt`, and the resolver derives
  same-day retained prior decisions from `status_marked_at` plus the user's
  local midnight boundary without adding a stored flag or status.
- Timeline service now fetches prior unresolved rows and prior resolved rows
  marked during the current local day, while the Needs Decision count continues
  to count only prior unresolved occurrences.
- Implemented Ticket 033 Analytics selected-day occurrence correction.
- Analytics selected-day data now lists all occurrences for the selected local
  date, including Completed, Not Completed, and Unresolved rows with status and
  note-state labels.
- Analytics selected-day review reuses the existing occurrence status and note
  services through `/analytics` server actions, preserving status-event
  semantics and refreshing the route after corrections.
- Updated route/resolver/design docs, the design-system fixture/usage map, and
  resolver tests. No schema, provider, navigation, dashboard/history route, bulk
  edit, offline mutation, stored missed status, or AI/coaching scope was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/timeline.resolver.test.ts tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (39 files, 253 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Browser QA: local Chrome against `http://localhost:3000` verified
  `/design-system#ds-module-analytics-screen` and
  `/design-system#ds-module-timeline` at 1280px and 390px with no horizontal
  overflow, no browser warnings/errors, visible `Review selected day`, selected
  day status/note controls, and the Needs decision button. Protected
  `/analytics` and `/timeline` redirected unauthenticated sessions to `/login`
  at both widths without horizontal overflow or browser warnings/errors.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA used fixture-backed authenticated UI through `/design-system`
  because the automated Chrome context did not have a Supabase session.

### Analytics behavior-day correction refinement

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Removed the Analytics page header description that showed `Local day
  boundary: <timezone>`.
- Converted the Overall adherence calendar into a passive summary. Overall day
  cells no longer open the correction panel.
- Added behavior-specific review selection through the `behavior` and `day`
  query parameters. The Analytics resolver now returns `selectedBehaviorDay`
  rows filtered by behavior id and local date, and marks the selected
  behavior calendar cell without making the UI filter review rows.
- Moved occurrence status/note correction into a compact Review day area inside
  the selected behavior row. It reuses the existing Analytics server actions
  and Timeline status/note controls.
- Updated the dev-only design-system Analytics fixture plus product, UI,
  user-flow, route, resolver-registry, design, and status docs.
- No schema, migration, provider, notification, export, route-navigation,
  dashboard/history route, bulk edit, stored missed status, or AI/coaching
  scope was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: targeted ESLint for Analytics page/component/resolver/service/test and
  design-system fixture files.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (41 files, 257 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass:
  `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/verify_traceability.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --usage design-system.usage.json --bench app/design-system/page.tsx`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Browser QA: Playwright with system Chrome against
  `http://localhost:3000/design-system?preview=module.analytics-screen#ds-module-analytics-screen`
  at 1280px and 390px showed the Analytics fixture with no horizontal
  overflow, no console warnings/errors, no `Local day boundary` copy, no old
  `Review selected day`/`Select a day to review` copy, passive overall
  calendar cells, behavior calendar review links, and the in-row Review day
  panel.
- Browser QA: unauthenticated `/analytics` redirected to
  `/login?next=%2Fanalytics` at 1280px and 390px with no horizontal overflow,
  no console warnings/errors, and no local-boundary copy.

Remaining risk:
- Authenticated live `/analytics` production-data QA was not performed because
  the browser context did not have a Supabase session; the same
  `AnalyticsScreen` was verified through the fixture-backed design-system
  route.
- The worktree already contained unrelated auth/proxy/package/design-system
  edits before this task; this refinement did not revert or normalize them.

### Analytics behavior-day scroll retention

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated behavior calendar review links on Analytics to preserve scroll
  position while opening a selected behavior day. This prevents the page from
  jumping back to the top when the in-row Review day panel opens.
- No resolver, service, schema, route, provider, export, or product-scope
  changes were added.

Verification:
- Pass: targeted ESLint for `components/analytics/AnalyticsScreen.tsx`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run build`.

Remaining risk:
- Authenticated live click QA was not performed because the browser context did
  not have a Supabase session.

### Analytics top-fold layout compaction

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Reworked the top Overall adherence section so the active range selector sits
  beside the heading on desktop, while the adherence percentage and status
  counts stay grouped in the left summary column.
- Moved the overall calendar into the same fold as the summary on desktop,
  kept only the See Legend control above it, and removed the extra divider
  line between the heading/range row and summary body.
- Added compact date hover/focus labels to Analytics heatmap cells using the
  existing resolver-provided short date label.
- Removed the extra divider line above Behavior counts.
- Changed behavior category display from a bordered chip beside the behavior
  name to plain `Category: <name>` metadata below the behavior name.
- Enlarged behavior heatmaps so 30-day calendars fill more of the row height
  while preserving the seven-column square-cell aspect ratio.
- Kept the mobile order stacked and readable: heading, range selector,
  adherence metric, counts, then calendar.
- No resolver, service, schema, route, provider, export, navigation, or
  product-scope changes were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (41 files, 257 tests).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/analytics` at 1024x768 verified no
  horizontal overflow, no Calendar heading, no top border/padding on the
  summary body or Behavior counts section, no behavior category chips,
  `Category: Medical` metadata, 304px by 216px behavior heatmaps in the 30-day
  view, short date `data-hover-label` values, and no warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser `/analytics` at 390px verified no
  horizontal overflow, no Calendar heading, plain category metadata, the larger
  behavior calendar staying inside the viewport, and no warning/error logs.

Remaining risk:
- The in-app browser automation did not expose CSS `:hover` state from
  programmatic mouse movement, including CDP mouse events. The heatmap cells
  have the expected `data-hover-label` attributes and tooltip CSS, but the
  visual hover chip was not proven through automated hover-state capture.

### Analytics behavior-day review cohesion

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Reworked the selected behavior-day Analytics review so it reads as one
  cohesive expansion inside the selected behavior row rather than a divided
  subtable.
- Removed internal divider lines from the review area and replaced the Review
  day heading with Behavior date.
- Replaced scheduled-time/status chips and note-state labels with plain text
  rows for Time of behavior, Status, and Note. Empty notes display as italic
  No note; saved notes display the note text.
- Hid per-occurrence status and note editing behind a Review disclosure by
  default. When opened, Change status sits beside the Completed / Not Completed
  actions when space allows, followed by the existing Note form.
- Removed the stale Analytics selected-day `noteStateLabel` resolver/type
  field and refreshed the design-system usage line numbers.
- Updated `DESIGN.md`, `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, and `docs/USER_FLOWS.md` for the new
  behavior-day review contract.
- No schema, route, provider, notification, export, navigation, dashboard,
  stored-status, or product-scope changes were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts`.
- Pass: targeted ESLint for the Analytics component/resolver/types/test and
  design-system fixture files.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: design-system usage scan for current line numbers.
- Pass:
  `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/verify_traceability.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --usage design-system.usage.json --bench app/design-system/page.tsx`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (41 files, 257 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Browser QA: in-app browser against
  `http://127.0.0.1:3000/design-system?preview=module.analytics-screen#ds-module-analytics-screen`
  at 1280px verified Behavior date copy, no Review day copy, plain Time of
  behavior / Status / Note labels, no internal review borders, Review closed by
  default, no horizontal overflow, and no warning/error logs.
- Browser QA: the desktop Review disclosure opened with a 512px editor,
  Change status aligned with the Completed action, visible Note textarea, and
  no horizontal overflow.
- Browser QA: at 390px mobile, the closed and opened review states had no
  horizontal overflow, the Note textarea fit the available panel width, and the
  status controls wrapped as expected.

Remaining risk:
- Authenticated live `/analytics` production-data QA was not performed because
  the browser context did not have a Supabase session; the same
  `AnalyticsScreen` was verified through the fixture-backed design-system
  route.
- The design-system inventory scan still reports broader pre-existing manifest
  drift outside this touched Analytics surface. This refinement refreshed only
  the usage map line numbers affected by the edited component.

### Minimal action primitive and divider rollout

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Replaced the product button primitive with transparent underlined text
  actions. Primary actions now use Ink Black, secondary actions use Readable
  Ash, and destructive actions use Rust Signal.
- Propagated the primitive through auth, Timeline status/note actions,
  behavior create/edit/archive/restore controls, settings actions, export and
  BehaviorLog import/restore controls, legal links, design-system previews, and
  marketing CTAs.
- Replaced non-functional full perimeter panel borders with divider-based
  sections across onboarding, login, settings, export, shared placeholder
  panels, and action feedback messages.
- Preserved real boundaries for form fields, segmented selected controls,
  heatmap cells, dense preview tables, dialogs, and the fixed Needs decision
  launcher.
- Updated `DESIGN.md` and `docs/UI_SPEC.md` so future UI work keeps primary
  actions black, secondary actions grey, and structural containers unboxed.
- No schema, route, provider, notification, export-format, stored-status, or
  product-scope changes were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (41 files, 257 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass:
  `python3 /Users/emi/.codex/skills/design-system-bench/scripts/verify_traceability.py --root . --manifest design-system.manifest.json --usage design-system.usage.json --bench app/design-system/page.tsx --config design-system.config.json`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check`.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:build`.
- Browser QA: restarted local dev server on `http://localhost:3000` and
  verified `/design-system` at 1280px and 390px. Primary primitive computed as
  transparent, 0px border, underlined Ink Black; secondary computed as
  transparent, 0px border, underlined Readable Ash; disabled stayed muted with
  no underline; overlay panel computed white with no perimeter border; no
  horizontal overflow on either viewport.

Remaining risk:
- Authenticated live app routes were not manually walked with a signed-in
  Supabase session. The changed authenticated components were covered through
  fixture-backed design-system previews, static scans, typecheck, tests, and
  build.

### Marketing hero and header cleanup

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Reworked the Astro homepage hero into a cleaner two-column composition with
  the supplied single exported image that combines the trajectory horse,
  MacBook Pro frame, and sanitized Cadence Timeline capture.
- Removed the marketing header bottom divider and changed marketing navigation
  links to the underlined text-action convention. The Log in app-entry action
  now uses the same primitive with stronger weight instead of a filled button.
- Reduced marketing H2 scale by one step so secondary section headings no
  longer compete with the homepage H1.
- Added the supplied hero image under `apps/marketing/public/brand/`.
- Updated `DESIGN.md`, `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, and `design-system.surfaces.json`
  so the header treatment, H2 scale, and hero visual are documented and
  traceable.
- No schema, route, provider, resolver, stored-status, notification, export, or
  product-scope changes were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (41 files, 257 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:build`.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Design-system maintenance scan: usage scan still reports 30 product usages
  and 0 bench previews. The generic inventory scan detects broader Astro
  surface files that remain intentionally cataloged through
  `design-system.surfaces.json` rather than the strict web-app manifest.
- Browser QA: local Astro dev server rendered the homepage at 1280x900 with no
- Browser QA: `http://localhost:4321/` rendered the homepage at 1280x900 with
  no header divider, underlined text-action navigation, the supplied hero image
  in place, `Log in` computed as transparent, borderless, underlined, and
  `font-weight: 600`, and the first H2 computed at 46.08px instead of the prior
  larger scale.
- Browser QA: 390x844 capture showed wrapped CTAs, no measured document-level
  horizontal overflow, `Log in` computed as transparent, borderless,
  underlined, and `font-weight: 600`, and the first H2 computed at 31.2px.

Remaining risk:
- The homepage hero is now a static exported image. Future copy or sample-data
  changes inside the image require regenerating the source image asset.

### Behaviors unresolved detail count removal

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Removed the Unresolved row from per-behavior and category detail count grids
  on Behaviors while preserving the top Overall adherence Unresolved count,
  neutral unresolved heatmap cells, and behavior date review rows.
- Updated product, UI, user-flow, and design docs so behavior/category detail
  count grids are resolved-outcome summaries only.
- No resolver, schema, route, provider, export, navigation, or product-scope
  expansion was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (55 files, 320 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Browser QA: headless Chrome against
  `http://localhost:3000/design-system?preview=module.behavior-list#ds-module-behavior-list`
  at 1024px and 390px showed no horizontal overflow, the Overall adherence
  count grid still showing Unresolved, and behavior/category count grids
  showing only Completed and Not Completed.

Remaining risk:
- Authenticated in-app browser QA for live `/behaviors` could not be automated:
  the Browser MCP was unavailable in this thread and Computer Use is blocked
  from inspecting the Codex app. The same `BehaviorList` surface was verified
  through the fixture-backed design-system route.

### UX journey inventory and testing backbone

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added `docs/UX_JOURNEY_INVENTORY.md` with seven testing personas and 22
  current-scope journey families across marketing, login, first-run setup,
  behavior creation/maintenance, Timeline, Needs decision, review/correction,
  reminders, timezone, export/import/restore, legal/trust, account deletion,
  mobile navigation, and machine-readable public docs.
- Added `docs/UX_TESTING_PLAN.md` with persona assignment, environment and
  viewport matrix, safe-data rules, severity model, observation rubric, and 13
  task scripts for future expert or participant testing.
- Added `docs/UX_RESEARCH_LOG.md` as the durable research and bug/glitch log.
  The initial pass records UX-001 through UX-035, including sub-agent findings
  for acquisition/trust, first-run activation, daily Timeline,
  recovery/review, reminders/settings, and portability.
- The pass intentionally did not implement UI or behavior fixes. Findings that
  came from source review are marked Open or Needs reproduction so future work
  can verify them in browser before changing product behavior.
- Existing dirty files in auth/behavior UI components were not touched.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (55 files, 324 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- No live browser walkthrough was performed in this pass. Several source-review
  findings in `docs/UX_RESEARCH_LOG.md` are explicitly marked Needs
  reproduction before implementation.

### Behavior schedules hierarchy and form update

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added `behavior_schedules` as the recurrence-owning parent of schedule time
  entries, linked `behavior_schedule_slots` to schedules, backfilled existing
  behavior rows into one schedule, and preserved legacy behavior-level
  `recurrence_rule`/`scheduled_time` compatibility.
- Reworked Behavior create/edit parsing, service writes, repository reads, and
  cached behavior/export mapping so old records normalize to `schedules[]` and
  new saves persist multiple schedules with multiple exact-time or range
  entries.
- Updated occurrence generation to iterate schedules, expand each schedule's
  recurrence and time entries, preserve timezone/history behavior, and merge
  duplicate generated occurrences with the same behavior, local date, start
  time, and end-time/range identity before reminders or analytics see them.
- Rebuilt the Behavior form schedule section into the compact table-like
  hierarchy: Add time stays inside a schedule, Add schedule creates a new
  recurrence row, custom time ranges are supported, reminders are separated by
  a divider, decorative form icons were avoided, and Save behavior uses the
  product-action primary primitive.
- Updated JSON/JSONL/full JSON/BehaviorLog export paths to include app-native
  `schedules[]` while keeping backward-compatible schedule fields.
- Updated product, data model, recurrence, UI, user-flow, notification, export,
  date/time, decisions, and resolver-registry docs for the new hierarchy.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (55 files, 331 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run supabase -- db reset`.
- Pass: Supabase local type generation with
  `npm run --silent supabase -- gen types typescript --local`, redirected to
  `lib/db/database.types.ts`, after removing the earlier npm banner pollution
  from the documented non-silent command.
- Pass: hosted migration deployment with `npm run supabase -- db push`;
  `npm run supabase -- migration list` confirmed local and remote histories
  match through `20260626140000`.
- Pass: hosted `npm run smoke:rls` after the schema/RLS change.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- Chrome-extension QA against local `/behaviors` created a temporary two-schedule
  behavior, verified the persisted summary
  `Schedule 1: Daily, 8:00 AM, 11:00 PM; Schedule 2: Every 2 days, 11:00 PM -
  11:30 PM`, opened the edit form, and archived the temporary behavior.
- Hosted application code was not deployed in this pass; only the hosted
  Supabase migration was pushed.

### Behavior form browser-comment polish

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Applied the annotated `/behaviors` form polish: Details now titles the
  title/category/description group, Category uses a narrower responsive column
  than Title, Schedule no longer has a top divider or schedule-count label, and
  the overlap helper copy now includes the requested leading asterisk.
- Reworked the description field into an auto-growing single-underline
  textarea so the underline stays directly under the entered text as line
  breaks are added.
- Restored named time-range presets for schedule entries and removed native
  time inputs from the form, avoiding the clock icons while preserving exact
  `HH:MM` entry and custom ranges.
- Applied the second annotated form-density pass: create-form contents align
  under the Create behavior summary text, field controls use shorter underline
  heights, Details has more breathing room before Title, recurrence interval
  controls stay on one line, time entries no longer draw a perimeter box or
  duplicate the selected range label, the Time mode column was removed, nested
  Add time/Add schedule actions are lower-emphasis, and Reminders no longer has
  its own top divider.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behavior-form.test.ts` (12 tests).
- Pass: `npm run test` (55 files, 334 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: Chrome-extension QA against local `/behaviors`: verified Details,
  Schedule, and Reminders legends; no native `input[type="time"]` controls in
  the open form; preset range options for Custom range, Morning, Afternoon,
  Evening, and Night; product-action primary Save behavior styling; helper copy
  with the leading asterisk; and auto-growing description behavior.
- Pass: Chrome-extension QA after the second pass against local `/behaviors`:
  verified compact 32px title/category controls, 32px Details-to-Title visual
  gap, create-form x-position aligned with the Create behavior summary text, no
  Time mode text, no preset range summary label, unboxed time-entry wrapper,
  smaller nested add-action classes, no horizontal overflow at 390px mobile,
  and desktop/mobile screenshots.

Remaining risk:
- The second browser-comment pass is verified locally but has not been pushed to
  hosted production yet.

### Behaviors review browser-comment polish

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Applied the annotated `/behaviors` review polish: Overall adherence now uses
  a single label/percentage header row with a colon, the selected range sits
  directly underneath in muted text, and the percentage uses the section-scale
  20px type instead of the prior large metric treatment.
- Aligned the expanded Details and Settings content with the disclosure trigger
  label start, moved Archive behavior to the far side of the Save/Cancel footer
  line on desktop while keeping it as a separate form, and normalized the
  annotated action text to 12px.
- Aligned the overlapping-occurrences helper copy with the Add time control and
  raised Add schedule to the 12px text-action size.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md` and `DESIGN.md` so the Behaviors review source of
  truth matches the new adherence header/range and Archive footer placement.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (55 files, 341 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser against local `/behaviors` at
  1545x1425 verified 0px Details alignment delta, Overall adherence percentage
  at 20px, range 4px under the heading row, Add schedule/Save/Cancel/Archive
  at 12px, Save/Cancel/Archive sharing the same footer y-position, overlap
  helper aligned with Add time, and no horizontal overflow.
- Browser QA: authenticated in-app browser at 390x844 verified 0px Details
  alignment delta, 12px stacked footer actions, 20px overall percentage, and no
  horizontal overflow.

Remaining risk:
- This local polish pass has not been pushed to hosted production yet.

### UX tickets 048-052 baseline correctness pass

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Completed Ticket 048 by running a browser-based reproduction and triage pass
  over the highest-risk Settings, Timeline, Needs Decision, first-run,
  reminder-readiness, import/restore, deletion, and mobile journeys using the
  local dev server plus design-system previews. `docs/UX_RESEARCH_LOG.md` now
  records observed results, ticket ownership, fixed/deferred states, and
  input-dependent blockers.
- Completed Ticket 049 by preserving `/settings#timezone` while giving the
  timezone input a unique `timezone-input` id, adding concise timezone impact
  copy, and mirroring account-deletion acknowledgement plus typed-confirmation
  gates in the client disabled state while keeping server validation.
- Completed Ticket 050 by moving the first-run setup panel below the mobile
  header safe area, constraining its viewport height, and leaving dismissal
  browser-local and non-blocking for v1.
- Completed Ticket 051 by preserving scroll context for Show more days,
  keeping expanded row details inside the native disclosure, and reducing
  repeated title noise in multi-slot Timeline groups with a neutral "Multiple
  scheduled times" header.
- Completed Ticket 052 by adding Needs Decision focus trapping, Escape close,
  launcher focus restoration, factual zero-count retained-row copy, and docs
  that same-day retention covers any prior-day occurrence resolved today rather
  than only rows resolved from inside the modal.
- Follow-up approved hosted QA on 2026-07-09 found and fixed a browser push
  setup race: the client now waits for an active service worker before creating
  a PushManager subscription. `tests/push-browser.test.ts` covers the active
  service-worker wait.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`
  so the implemented Timeline, first-run, Settings, and Needs Decision
  contracts match the code.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (56 files, 345 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Follow-up pass after hosted QA and browser push fix: Pass: `npm run
  smoke:rls`; Pass: `npx vitest run tests/push-browser.test.ts` (7 tests);
  Pass: `npm run agents:check`; Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`; Pass: `npm
  run lint`; Pass: `npm run typecheck`; Pass: `npm run test` (56 files, 346
  tests); Pass: `npm run build`; Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Earlier focused passes during the implementation: `npx vitest run
  tests/ux-ticket-049-052-ui.test.tsx`; `npx vitest run
  tests/ux-ticket-049-052-ui.test.tsx tests/timeline.resolver.test.ts
  tests/settings.service.test.ts tests/account-deletion.service.test.ts
  tests/timeline-optimistic-status.test.ts`.
- Browser QA: local design-system previews at desktop, 390px, and 320px showed
  no horizontal overflow for first-run, Timeline, Settings, and Needs Decision
  states. Needs Decision keyboard smoke verified launcher focus, open focus,
  Shift+Tab/Tab containment, Escape close, and focus return.
- Follow-up browser QA after owner approval: system Chrome against local
  dev/test-login and hosted Supabase created disposable source/target accounts,
  rendered clean-account first-run `/timeline` at desktop and 390px without
  overflow, verified Timeline status controls, downloaded a BehaviorLog bundle,
  applied create-only import into a second account, saved browser notifications
  in a persistent Chrome profile, verified denied-notification Settings copy,
  verified `/settings#timezone` anchor/label/mobile layout, and deleted the
  disposable accounts through Settings account deletion. Final test-login
  cleanup found no stale users to delete.

Remaining risk:
- Restore preview accepted a real Cadence-exported BehaviorLog bundle but
  blocked destructive restore apply because the preview contained skipped
  actions. The confirmed compatibility issue is that Cadence export emits
  schedule ids like `sch_<uuid>`, while the current restore apply path expects
  UUID core identifiers. Import create-only still succeeded with the same
  bundle. This is now tracked as Ticket 059 before claiming end-to-end restore
  apply works for Cadence-generated bundles.

### Ticket 053: Browser reminder readiness clarity

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated the Behavior form reminder copy so browser reminders are framed as
  behavior-level intent that uses devices enabled in Settings, while tracking
  still works when the current device is not enabled or browser notifications
  are blocked.
- Added a service-worker regression test that proves notification clicks
  navigate an existing same-origin Cadence tab to the notification target,
  defaulting to the Timeline-origin path, before focusing it.
- Added a focused Reminder editor markup regression so future copy changes do
  not blur behavior intent with current-device notification readiness.
- Updated the UI spec and UX research log for the closed browser reminder
  findings.
- No schema, provider, reminder-delivery processing, new Settings surfaces,
  test-send buttons, dashboards, PWA/offline behavior, or notification
  permission prompts on page load were added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npx vitest run tests/reminder-editor-ui.test.tsx tests/push-service-worker.test.ts tests/push-browser.test.ts` (3 files, 9 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (58 files, 348 tests).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run build`.

Remaining risk:
- Browser notification delivery itself was not re-smoked during this ticket.
  The existing hosted QA record already covers successful subscription save and
  production browser-push delivery; this ticket only hardened readiness copy and
  click routing coverage.

### Ticket 054: Later correction and review discoverability

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated actionable per-behavior heatmap cells to advertise the correction
  path with an "open day review" accessible/title hint while leaving empty
  cells passive.
- Renamed the selected behavior-day review heading from generic "Review" to
  "Review selected day".
- Added Clear decision only inside behavior-date review. It returns the
  selected occurrence to Unresolved; Timeline and Needs decision do not expose
  a global Clear decision action.
- Added a static UI regression covering the heatmap review scent, selected-day
  heading, occurrence detail rows, and the scoped Clear decision path.
- Updated `docs/UI_SPEC.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and
  `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md` to match the implemented behavior.
- Did not add a global Clear decision, a history route, bulk edit, automatic
  suggestions, AI coaching, or a dense analytics dashboard.

Verification:
- Pass: focused Ticket 054 tests (4 files).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (60 files, 353 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: an owner-approved agent proxy browser walkthrough of the local,
  authenticated `/behaviors` review path at desktop and 390px. It did not
  mutate records or capture real-data screenshots; it is not human evidence.

Remaining risk:
- Future human TS07 evidence can further validate discovery of the behavior
  heatmap review path. It is not a blocker for Ticket 054 completion.

### Ticket 055: Portability flow comprehension hardening

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added concise task-based guidance to export download rows for JSONL, CSV, app
  JSON, and BehaviorLog.
- Relabeled the UI's JSON download as "App JSON snapshot" and documented that
  status-event history lives in BehaviorLog, not the app-native JSON snapshot.
- Surfaced unsupported-field counts and sensitive-note warning counts in the
  BehaviorLog import dry-run summary.
- Changed import and restore recent-run timestamp fallbacks from "Open" to
  "Still open" so completed rows do not read as an action.
- Tightened the import apply acknowledgement copy to "I reviewed this exact
  preview."
- Defined the accepted-preview binding contract: import apply must use one
  persisted accepted `merge_preview` run, verify matching bundle, local-data,
  and combined preview fingerprints before writing, reject stale or altered
  input, and retain the accepted preview relationship on the applied run.
- Restore preview runs now capture an explicit start time before synchronous
  preview computation and a completion time afterward, so completed previews no
  longer appear open merely because `completed_at` was omitted.
- Restore preview UI now shows high/restricted note counts and redacted
  intervention-field counts alongside the destructive-action summary.
- The local design-system bench can render accepted, stale, invalid,
  warning-heavy, and destructive import/restore states with no product writes;
  its accepted-preview action uses a bench-only server action.
- Updated `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md`, `docs/UI_SPEC.md`,
  `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, and
  `docs/TICKETS.md`.
- Did not add broad restore automation, hidden destructive writes, provider
  sends, admin repair tools, AI interpretation, or new product data categories.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/export-panel-ui.test.tsx tests/behaviorlog-import-ui.test.tsx tests/behaviorlog-restore-ui.test.tsx tests/export.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-restore.resolver.test.ts` (6 files, 40 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (60 files, 353 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: focused accepted-preview/restore/export suite (8 files, 68 tests).
- Pass after the restore timestamp/count/bench follow-up:
  `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-ui.test.tsx
  tests/behaviorlog-restore-ui.test.tsx
  tests/behaviorlog-restore-apply.service.test.ts` (3 files, 24 tests).
- Pass: clean local `SUPABASE_NO_TELEMETRY=1 npm run supabase -- db reset`
  through `20260709191905_bind_import_apply_to_accepted_preview.sql` and the
  next queued Ticket 057 migration.
- Pass: local Supabase type regeneration matched the checked-in schema types;
  only the generator's trailing blank line differed before replacement.
- Browser QA: local fixture bench at 1280px and 390px verified accepted-preview
  apply success through a no-write bench action, stale-local-data refusal,
  invalid-preview disabled actions, high-sensitivity acknowledgement, visible
  restore safety counts, destructive restore action disclosure without apply,
  and no page or panel horizontal overflow.
- Pass after all five-ticket integration work settled: `npm run agents:check`
  (95 invariants), `npm run resolvers:check` (152 invariants),
  `npm run design-system:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run test` (67 files, 428 tests), `npm run build`, and
  `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- Browser QA used the real import and restore components through the local
  design-system fixture bench, not the authenticated `/export` route. It made
  no product writes and is agent-proxy evidence rather than human research.
- Destructive restore apply remains outside this ticket's browser QA scope and
  was not run against the user's real account.
- Hosted deployment of
  `20260709191905_bind_import_apply_to_accepted_preview.sql` still requires
  owner authorization before the accepted-preview contract is live in the
  linked Supabase project.

### Ticket 056: Public trust and marketing comprehension

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added low-priority Trust, Privacy, and Terms links to the Astro marketing
  footer, pointing at the authenticated app's public account-information pages.
- Added `/docs.md` to the marketing `/docs` Machine files table so the visible
  page matches the generated Markdown mirror and route-manifest outputs.
- Revised Trust account-isolation copy to state the implemented Supabase Auth
  and Row Level Security ownership model without adding unsupported guarantees.
- Added a Cadence overview return link to public legal/trust pages.
- Updated legal-content regression tests and the UX research log for the fixed
  trust/legal/machine-file findings.
- Ran three independent owner-approved agent-proxy browser walkthroughs before
  and after the homepage copy correction. Initial findings consistently showed
  that Cadence and BehaviorLog could be conflated and that "open tracker" was
  ambiguous. The revised first viewport names Cadence as an open-source,
  personal tracker and BehaviorLog as the portable export file format Cadence
  reads and writes. Reruns completed discovery, portability, and pre-login
  trust tasks without material product-versus-format confusion.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/legal-content.test.tsx` (1 file, 2 tests).
- Pass: `npm run marketing:build`.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check`.
- Pass: independent browser walkthroughs before and after the homepage copy
  change, plus visual checks at desktop and 390px.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (60 files, 363 tests).
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- The walkthroughs are owner-approved agent proxy testing, not real-user
  research. Do not claim externally validated marketing comprehension until
  independent first-time human-user testing repeats the same tasks.

### Ticket 057: Behavior definition history and portability

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added the append-only, RLS-protected `behavior_definition_events` table for
  title and description baselines and transitions. Existing behaviors receive
  a faithful baseline of their currently stored definition without inventing
  prior revisions.
- Added resolver-owned definition normalization and change planning, plus
  owner-scoped repository access.
- Behavior create and update now write the behavior and its definition event in
  one database transaction. Definition-changing and schedule-only updates both
  reject a stale stored definition; true definition no-ops do not create an
  event.
- Create-only and approved-merge imports create their behavior baseline in the
  same transaction as the behavior. Restore-specific definition transitions
  are completed by Ticket 059's atomic restore wrapper.
- Full JSON includes sorted definition history. BehaviorLog includes the
  optional `raw/cadence/behavior_definition_events.jsonl` extension with
  manifest, Markdown guidance, privacy disclosure, and export UI copy.
- Import and restore use current definitions to create local baselines or
  transitions; they do not replay earlier Cadence-only revision history from an
  exported extension.

Verification:
- Pass: focused behavior-definition, behavior-create, import-write, export,
  conformance, and RLS tests.
- Pass: clean local `SUPABASE_NO_TELEMETRY=1 npm run supabase -- db reset`
  through `20260709203154_make_behaviorlog_restore_atomic_and_idempotent.sql`.
- Pass: local Supabase TypeScript type regeneration from the reset schema.
- Pass: local export/import fixture browser checks at 1280px and 390px with no
  horizontal overflow.
- Pass after all five-ticket integration work settled: `npm run agents:check`
  (95 invariants), `npm run resolvers:check` (152 invariants),
  `npm run design-system:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run test` (67 files, 428 tests), `npm run build`, and
  `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- The backfill records each existing behavior's current stored definition at
  its original creation timestamp; it cannot reconstruct unrecorded historical
  edits from before this ticket.

### Ticket 058: Status timestamp and status history export hardening

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Full JSON now includes an additive, sorted `status_events` array for exported
  occurrences while preserving unchanged current occurrence snapshots.
- The export remains backward compatible for existing snapshot readers. The
  event records preserve correction links, status semantics, recorded/effective
  timestamps, source metadata, and reason code.
- Markdown now explains that occurrence rows are snapshots and directs agents
  to status events for corrections and decision chronology. JSONL and CSV keep
  their snapshot `status_marked_at` fields without implying full history.
- The Export UI calls the JSON download an app JSON backup and names its status
  event history. No status-history UI or future source values were added.
- Manual status marks, corrections, and clears now call one owner-scoped
  database function that locks the occurrence, verifies both the expected
  snapshot status and latest-event id, updates the snapshot, appends its event,
  and performs resolver-planned pending-reminder cancellation atomically.
- Repeating the already-current resolved status is an idempotent no-op. A true
  correction links the locked latest event, including corrections after a
  prior clear; stale and ABA plans are rejected rather than corrupting the
  correction chain.
- Note-only edits remain a separate event-free update and preserve status
  timestamps. The migration does not invent internal high-confidence events
  for legacy resolved snapshots that lack one; export keeps using its explicit
  derived, medium-confidence fallback.

Verification:
- Pass: focused export, panel, status, occurrence-service, and BehaviorLog
  conformance tests (5 files, 44 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (60 files, 365 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: focused status resolver, occurrence service/repository, migration, and
  reminder tests.
- Pass: rollback-only live local SQL transaction smoke covering atomic
  snapshot/event/reminder writes, repeated taps, clear/correction linkage,
  ABA refusal, cross-owner refusal, and rollback after a forced event failure.
- Pass: clean local migration reset and regenerated Supabase TypeScript types.
- Pass after all five-ticket integration work settled: `npm run agents:check`
  (95 invariants), `npm run resolvers:check` (152 invariants),
  `npm run design-system:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run test` (67 files, 428 tests), `npm run build`, and
  `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- Some older migrations synthesized high-confidence status events for records
  they could classify at the time. This ticket deliberately does not rewrite
  existing history; new missing-event legacy snapshots are represented only by
  the export-time derived fallback.

### Ticket 059: BehaviorLog restore apply for Cadence schedule IDs

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Updated restore apply payload construction to resolve accepted create actions
  with non-UUID BehaviorLog external ids to deterministic local UUIDs scoped by
  user, bundle fingerprint, record type, and external id.
- Deterministic IDs are scoped by user, bundle fingerprint, record type, and
  external id even when the external id is already UUID-shaped, preventing
  cross-account global-primary-key collisions.
- Bound the apply run to one exact accepted preview and a database-canonical
  SHA-256 of the complete restore payload. The wrapper revalidates preview,
  bundle, local-data, payload, policy, action, mapping, and destructive-target
  identities before any product write.
- Added exact absent/unchanged row preconditions, deterministic lock ordering,
  and updated-at ownership checks so data changed after preview is refused
  rather than overwritten.
- Product rows, behavior definition baselines/transitions, provenance mappings,
  and the applied-run result now commit or roll back in one database
  transaction. The previous product-write helper is hidden from app roles.
- Preserved append-only status history: restore apply supports only accepted
  status-event creates under `preserve_append_only_history`; replacement remains
  preview-only and is disabled in both service and UI.
- Added one-applied-run-per-preview idempotency. Exact retries return the stored
  result, concurrent duplicates are cancelled or reuse it, and an uncertain
  client response cannot downgrade an already-applied ledger row to failed.
- Added a regression test using a Cadence-generated BehaviorLog bundle shape
  where a schedule external id is `sch_<uuid>`, an occurrence references that
  schedule, and a status event references the occurrence.
- Documented the restore mapping rule in `docs/EXPORT_FORMATS.md` and the
  mapping-table contract in `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`.
- No provider operation, new route, cross-account write privilege, or replay of
  exported historical definition revisions was added.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-restore-apply.service.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-restore.service.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-restore.resolver.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-restore-rpc-migration.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-restore-ui.test.tsx` (5 files, 13 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (58 files, 349 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: focused restore resolver, apply service, UI, and migration suites.
- Pass: clean local migration reset and regenerated Supabase TypeScript types.
- Pass: rollback-only live local SQL smoke covering payload binding, atomic
  ledger completion, exact idempotent replay, and post-binding tamper refusal
  with the pending ledger preserved.
- Pass after all five-ticket integration work settled: `npm run agents:check`
  (95 invariants), `npm run resolvers:check` (152 invariants),
  `npm run design-system:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run test` (67 files, 428 tests), `npm run build`, and
  `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- Destructive restore apply was not re-run against a hosted disposable account
  after this fix. That end-to-end browser QA still needs an owner-approved
  disposable account and fresh backup workflow before claiming hosted restore
  apply is production-smoked.
- The wrapper prevents cross-account writes and protects the accepted app
  workflow from stale or altered payloads. It is not intended as a security
  boundary against an authenticated owner who already has normal CRUD access to
  that same owner's product rows.

### Ticket 060: Schedule integrity and missing occurrence repair

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added the CLI-created idempotent schedule-integrity migration. It discovers
  every empty owned schedule without hardcoded product identifiers, inserts one
  exact compatibility slot, repairs only genuinely missing Unresolved
  occurrences for repaired active schedules from the stable local creation
  anchor through the 30-day horizon, preserves existing rows/statuses, skips
  archived occurrence generation, and marks affected account horizons stale.
- Added SQL recurrence parity helpers for daily/every-N-days,
  weekly/every-N-weeks, monthly last-day fallback, and Temporal-compatible
  timezone conversion for the one-time migration contract.
- Added pure schedule-graph normalization with typed valid, repairable, and
  invalid outcomes plus explicit historical occurrence-repair planning.
  Occurrence freshness now validates active schedules even when the stored
  horizon claims coverage; empty or ambiguous graphs surface a safe error,
  best-effort record `sync_failed`, and cannot be marked fresh.
- Moved manual Behavior form create/update onto owner-scoped atomic
  `SECURITY INVOKER` RPCs. Behavior data, optional definition history, complete
  schedule graph, and stale sync state now commit or roll back together.
  Updates bind to exact definition, schedule graph, and row-version state;
  schedule-only edits still append no definition event.
- Added repository, resolver, service, migration, and rollback-only local SQL
  coverage, plus a reusable `npm run smoke:schedule-integrity:local` command.
- Updated the data-model, recurrence, resolver ownership, and hosted operations
  contracts.
- Deployed the migration and compatible application after an owner-authorized
  backup/dry-run gate, then ran the protected occurrence-sync path and verified
  the repair with aggregate SQL and authenticated production browser QA.

Verification:
- Pass: focused Ticket 060 suite (6 files, 53 tests).
- Pass: clean local `npm run supabase -- db reset` through
  `20260717161342_repair_schedule_integrity_and_atomic_behavior_writes.sql`.
- Pass: regenerated `lib/db/database.types.ts` from the clean local schema.
- Pass: rollback-only `npm run smoke:schedule-integrity:local`, covering the
  active weekly repair fixture, archived/valid graphs, preserved Completed and
  Unresolved rows, idempotent replay, atomic create/update, stale and
  cross-owner refusal, and forced create/update slot-write rollback.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (95 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (156 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (68 files, 442 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: fresh pre-mutation user-owned full JSON export with archived behaviors
  and notes, plus a hosted `public` schema data-only SQL backup; both artifacts
  were non-empty before deployment.
- Pass: linked migration history check and `npm run supabase -- db push
  --linked --dry-run`; only
  `20260717161342_repair_schedule_integrity_and_atomic_behavior_writes.sql`
  was pending.
- Pass: owner-authorized `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes`; the
  Ticket 060 migration was the only applied migration.
- Pass: privacy-safe post-migration SQL proof: 37 schedules, 38 slots, zero
  empty schedules, zero active empty schedules, zero orphan/cross-owner slots,
  two repaired slots, seven exactly-once repaired occurrences, zero fabricated
  status events, zero past reminder deliveries, and one preserved Completed
  occurrence.
- Pass: protected production occurrence sync checked and synced 6 accounts
  with 0 skipped and 0 failed. Post-sync proof found 5 eligible current/future
  reminder deliveries, no past repair reminders, and one repaired account with
  a fresh horizon and no sync failure.
- Pass: Vercel production deployment
  `dpl_is4EZv6RhHrRCMAt2JRLeS3UG1Qu` reached `READY`; error-only build logs and
  the two-hour production runtime-error view reported no errors.
- Pass: authenticated production browser QA at `/timeline` and `/behaviors`.
  Needs decision exposed the two prior repaired Unresolved Friday rows; the
  2026-07-17, 2026-07-24, 2026-07-31, 2026-08-07, and 2026-08-14 rows each
  appeared once; the behavior heatmap/review exposed the repaired history and
  status/note controls; and the preserved Completed count remained 1. No
  occurrence was changed during QA.
- Pass: post-deploy `npm run smoke:rls` created and cleaned up 2 temporary
  users and verified all 6 ownership checks.
- Pass: post-deploy linked migration history is congruent through
  `20260717161342`.
- Pass with pre-existing warnings only: linked Supabase security/performance
  advisors returned no error-level finding and no Ticket 060 function warning.
  Existing warnings cover two authenticated restore `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs,
  leaked-password protection configuration, and RLS init-plan performance on
  existing table policies; they remain outside this ticket.

Remaining risk:
- The production application was deployed from the verified local workspace by
  Vercel CLI while the Ticket 060 changes were uncommitted (`gitDirty=1`). A
  later Git-triggered deployment from the current remote `main` would not
  contain Ticket 060 until these repository changes are committed and pushed.
- The SQL data-only backup reported circular foreign-key restore-order warnings
  for two existing tables. The fresh user-owned full JSON export is the primary
  product-restorable safety artifact for this deployment.

## Needs decision retained-date copy correction

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Changed the zero-unresolved label under retained prior-day date headers from
  `All decided today` to `None left to decide` so the copy describes the group
  state without calling a past date today.
- Updated the UI regression test to require the new label and reject both the
  old wording and `0 left to decide`.
- Added the retained, fully decided date-group state to the local design-system
  Needs decision preview and aligned the UI specification, user flow, and UX
  research record with the corrected wording.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run test -- tests/ux-ticket-049-052-ui.test.tsx` (1 file, 4
  tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (95 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (156 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (68 files, 442 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Browser QA: local design-system Needs decision preview at 1127x900 and
  390x844 rendered one `None left to decide` label, rendered no `All decided
  today` label, had no document-level horizontal overflow, and produced no
  browser warnings or errors.

Remaining risk:
- None identified. This is a copy-only product change and does not alter
  occurrence grouping, status storage, or Needs decision counts.

## Export prompt library (Ticket 061)

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added a typed static prompt module with twelve templates, one shared Cadence
  export-semantics preamble, and a DOM-independent clipboard helper.
- Added the Analysis prompts panel after the AI summary in the Export section.
  It uses unboxed native disclosure rows, format and option requirements,
  preformatted prompt text, an underlined Copy prompt action, and accessible
  copy-result feedback.
- Registered the prompt panel and copy action in the design-system manifest,
  bench previews, and generated usage map.
- Kept the feature static and UI-only. It does not alter export bundles, the
  BehaviorLog manifest, the AI summary, resolvers, services, API routes, or the
  database.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test`.
- Pass: `npm run build`.

Remaining risk:
- Clipboard availability still depends on the user's browser and permission
  context; unsupported or rejected writes show Copy unavailable.

## Canonical user interaction registry

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Added `interaction-registry.json` as the canonical machine-readable inventory
  of 83 implemented user interaction intents across the Astro marketing site,
  public login/account-information pages, authenticated app shell, onboarding,
  Timeline, Behaviors, Export & Import, and Settings.
- Each entry has a stable ID, surfaces and routes, UX journey links, intent,
  triggers and variants, availability, success/failure results, material side
  effects, risk and confirmation gates, implementation references, and an
  explicit test-coverage posture.
- Added `interaction-registry.schema.json` and
  `docs/INTERACTION_REGISTRY.md` for the field contract, scope, exclusions,
  maintenance workflow, and common queries.
- Added `npm run interactions:check`. The validator checks registry structure,
  unique IDs, known surfaces and journeys, every UX journey's coverage,
  implementation/test reference existence, destructive-action confirmation,
  interactive-source inventory coverage, and per-file interaction marker
  counts. `npm run agents:check` now invokes it automatically.
- Updated the agent rules, operations runbook, route-map maintenance checklist,
  and UX journey inventory to treat the registry as the interaction traceability
  source. No product UI, route behavior, resolver, service, database, or
  provider behavior changed.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run interactions:check` (3,428 invariants, 83 interactions, 33 UI
  sources).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (106 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (156 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check` (25 Astro files, 0 errors/warnings/hints;
  marketing agent-readability check passed).
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (70 files, 452 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build`. One sandboxed attempt could not reach Google Fonts;
  the authorized network retry fetched IBM Plex Sans and completed normally.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- Marker-count drift checks catch new interactive files and most control/event
  additions or removals. A semantic interaction change that preserves the same
  marker count still requires the documented registry update during review.

## Exhaustive interaction audit and persona guides

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Froze the exact 83-interaction, 97-trigger, 55-variant, 152-case baseline at
  126 pass, 22 fail, and 4 blocked cases. The immutable pre-fix report contains
  0 P0, 6 P1, 17 P2, and 4 P3 findings.
- Implemented the P1/P2 findings. The IA-002 ownership migration is deployed,
  the compatible authenticated app build is READY in production, and IA-023's
  audited marketing build is deployed. At the original audit cutoff, IA-024
  through IA-028 were documented as the subsequent P3 frontier; Ticket 062
  later closes IA-025 through IA-028 while leaving IA-024 decision-gated.
- The original remediation retest expanded the registry additively to schema
  1.1 with 85 interactions, 101 triggers, 55 variants, and required resolvable
  `user_guidance` metadata. Its dated 156-case matrix records 144 pass, 0 fail,
  and 12 blocked cases while preserving the frozen baseline evidence
  separately. The live registry is canonical and its later structural counts
  are recorded under Ticket 062.
- Added repository-only, task-based guides for Maya, Jordan, Priya, Sam, Lina,
  Robin, and Alex. Eighty-two interactions point to user guides;
  `INT-AUTH-002` and `INT-SHELL-007` point to the internal QA appendix. No
  product route was added for documentation.
- Redacted all retained screenshots. Deleted every task-created disposable
  account, cleared task downloads and isolated-browser tabs, reset temporary
  viewport changes, and did not use a personal account or recipient.
- Google OAuth, exact-subscription push, and Sequenzy-to-AgentMail delivery were
  blocked at the frozen audit cutoff, then passed in owner-authorized follow-up
  QA on 2026-07-23. The unscoped hosted reminder queue was not invoked.

Baseline verification:
- Pass: `npm run interactions:check` (3,428 invariants, 83 interactions, 33 UI
  sources).
- Pass: `npm run test` (70 files, 452 tests).
- Baseline commit: `79b964ac76f37d7dea1e40ae7a896afea086ebb1`.
- Baseline interaction-registry SHA-256:
  `852e30ff18a2dd45d31d3d13537d7d3f65c3f43a42ee30b57bf262735cc097a0`.

Final verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (106 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run interactions:check` (4,142 invariants, 84 interactions, 34
  sources).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (157 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check` (0 errors and 0 warnings).
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check` (0 errors, warnings, or hints).
- Pass: lint, typecheck, 523 tests in 78 files, build, and `git diff --check`.
- Blocked: `npm run supabase -- db reset`; Docker was unavailable. Later
  read-only hosted migration history confirms the IA-002 ownership migration
  is deployed.

Remaining environment limitation:
- A clean local Supabase reset still requires an available Docker engine.

## Audit follow-up: import size architecture, Unmark registration, sign-out

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Wrapped the push-endpoint ownership migration in an explicit transaction so
  its table lock is valid when the hosted CLI applies statements without an
  implicit transaction. The migration was subsequently deployed.
- Bound import and restore Apply to the exact previewed archive with a raw
  SHA-256 fingerprint while transporting base64 bytes only once. Set the
  advertised and enforced bundle limit to 2 MB and the Server Action request
  ceiling to 4 MB.
- Changed BehaviorLog ZIP output to DEFLATE and added a five-year,
  ten-daily-Behavior export sanity corpus. Its 18,260 Occurrences, roughly
  500-character Notes, and status history compressed to 1,230,362 bytes
  (1.173 MiB).
- Expanded `INT-TIMELINE-007` to cover Timeline **Unmark** and Behavior review
  **Clear decision** through the same Unresolved correction and still-future
  reminder reconciliation.
- Added `INT-SHELL-008` and a POST-only Sign out route, the expanded/collapsed
  desktop and mobile-drawer controls, and the focused **Signed out.** Login
  status.

Verification:
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (106 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run interactions:check` (4,199 invariants, 85 interactions, 34
  interaction sources).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (159 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check` (0 errors and 0 warnings; 27 components,
  51 product usages, 4 surfaces, and 14 canonical families).
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (80 files, 537 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build` (Next.js 16.2.7; `/auth/sign-out` included in the route
  manifest). One sandboxed retry could not reach Google Fonts; the approved
  network-enabled retry fetched IBM Plex Sans and passed.
- Pass: focused worst-case test output measured the BehaviorLog ZIP at
  1,230,362 bytes (1.173 MiB).
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- The clean local database reset remains environment-blocked while Docker is
  unavailable. Hosted migration history includes the ownership migration, and
  Vercel shows the compatible `635cdb8` authenticated app deployment as READY.

## Interaction audit P3 traceability and narrow-screen follow-up (Ticket 062)

Status: complete.

Implementation summary:
- Aligned IA-025 registry triggers and variants with exact visible labels for
  onboarding dismissal, desktop-rail controls, Behavior form cancellation,
  import apply actions, and Settings trust/legal links.
- Added IA-026 `INT-MKT-010` ownership to the marketing BaseLayout source
  inventory.
- Audited IA-027 across all 85 interactions. The live coverage posture is 59
  direct, 6 indirect, and 20 manual declarations. Direct references now point
  to focused interaction/UI tests; the checker rejects production or generator
  files as coverage evidence and distinguishes test references from repository
  check scripts.
- Fixed IA-028 with a zero-minimum Settings panel track, wrapping Profile
  identifiers, and bounded select/text-input timezone controls. Extracted the
  two timezone control variants so both responsive contracts are testable.
- Made the marketing agent-readability check tolerant of valid attributes and
  attribute ordering on `<main id="main">`, with focused regression coverage.
- Reconciled stale IA-002 and IA-023 deployment text, corrected the current
  route inventory, and kept the original interaction-audit reports clearly
  separated from the live 85-interaction, 105-trigger, 57-variant registry.
- Kept IA-024 unchanged because account-specific onboarding dismissal requires
  a product decision.

Verification:
- Read-only hosted Supabase migration history includes
  `20260722213732_enforce_single_active_push_endpoint_owner`.
- Read-only Vercel deployment history shows the authenticated app production
  deployment for commit `635cdb8d283b514b523cfbc4fc4b5bcf03394ed0`
  is `READY`.
- Read-only Vercel deployment history shows the owner-approved audited
  marketing production deployment is `READY`; its content checks are recorded
  in the interaction-audit remediation ledger.
- Pass: `npm run interactions:check` (4,295 invariants, 85 interactions, 34
  interaction sources).
- Pass: focused Ticket 062 coverage (14 files, 61 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (106 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check` (159 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run design-system:check` (0 errors and 0 warnings; 27 components,
  51 product usages, 4 surfaces, and 14 canonical families).
- Pass: `npm run marketing:build` and `npm run marketing:check` (26 Astro
  files, no errors, warnings, or hints; readability check passed).
- Pass: `npm run lint`.
- Pass: `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (87 files, 563 tests).
- Pass: `npm run build` (Next.js 16.2.7).
- Pass: authenticated browser QA with a 65-character disposable identifier at
  320px and 390px. At both widths, document scroll width equaled client width,
  the Profile identifier wrapped, and no descendant exceeded the viewport.
- Pass: temporary browser viewport/tab restoration and scoped test-login
  cleanup; one disposable `cadence-test-*@example.invalid` user was deleted.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Remaining risk:
- IA-024 is the only unresolved interaction-audit item and remains
  product-decision-gated.
- A clean local `npm run supabase -- db reset` still cannot run because no
  Docker engine is available. Ticket 062 has no schema changes, and hosted
  migration history confirms the previously pending IA-002 migration is
  deployed.

## Locust infrastructure stress-testing roadmap (Tickets 063-066)

Status: blocked (Ticket 066 provider and staging-target gates); Tickets 063-065
complete.

Planning summary:
- Ticket 063 defines the registry-derived load-test contract, classifies every
  live interaction for load suitability, and proves public, authenticated,
  export, and real Next.js Server Action request paths locally. It forbids a
  permanent test-only product API or weakened auth/RLS boundary.
- Ticket 064 adds exact run-scoped synthetic Supabase identities, fixture
  cohorts, session preparation, integrity/cleanup scripts, public and
  authenticated read workloads, and a bounded local baseline/ramp.
- Ticket 065 adds common status, note, Behavior lifecycle, review, timezone,
  export, occurrence-sync, fake-provider reminder, and same-account contention
  workloads plus spike, soak, breakpoint, recovery, and integrity gates.
- Ticket 066 is the only hosted capacity slice. It requires an isolated
  synthetic target, explicit owner authorization, Vercel policy approval, and
  Supabase coordination where current provider guidance requires it before any
  hosted load begins.
- The roadmap treats Locust as an HTTP/infrastructure tool, not a browser or UX
  substitute. Client-only registry interactions remain covered by the existing
  browser, component, accessibility, and interaction-audit evidence.
- Identity creation and sign-in occur outside timed capacity measurements so
  Supabase Auth limits do not distort ordinary route/action results. A
  separate future profile may measure Auth only if explicitly scoped.
- Real Google OAuth, Sequenzy email, Web Push, import/restore/account-deletion
  swarms, production user data, and unapproved Vercel traffic are excluded.

Current state:
- Ticket 063 completed on 2026-07-29.
- Ticket 064 completed on 2026-07-29.
- Ticket 065 completed on 2026-07-31. Its mixed mutation, spike/recovery, soak,
  breakpoint, changed-timezone, same-account contention, protected operator,
  loopback fake-provider, integrity, RLS, artifact, and exact-cleanup
  implementation passed its authoritative full run and final repository gates.
- Ticket 066 is blocked before traffic as of 2026-07-31. Hosted traffic has not
  started. Read-only provider discovery found no dedicated Cadence Vercel
  staging project and no separate Supabase staging project. Supabase reports a
  Pro organization. The Vercel Enterprise plan, Vercel approval, exact staging
  hostname, owner authorization, traffic window and sources, cost ceiling, and
  monitoring retention are not documented.
- Ticket 066 now has a fail-closed static single-stage preflight, 23 focused
  tests, provider request templates, human checkpoints, abort/rollback/cleanup
  procedures, and a sanitized blocked-readiness report. The preflight performs
  no network request and cannot launch Locust. It rejects production reuse,
  missing provider approval, unsafe data/provider posture, automatic stage
  advance, expired or excessive traffic, missing monitoring, source mismatch,
  dirty deployment evidence, and unsafe manifest files.
- Full retry `20260731t005526z-b2e8cca38514` passed every load stage through
  changed-timezone, including a zero-failure 60-minute soak, then rejected
  contention before any write. RLS passed, all 108 completed-stage artifacts
  reconciled, exact cleanup deleted 100 of 100 users, and zero product rows
  remained.
- Standalone contention run `20260731t040008z-e71b7359d3fb` proved that an
  active, untouched prior-day Behavior still failed on raw Timeline discovery.
  Needs decision rows mount only after client dialog state opens, so the HTTP
  response contains no occurrence forms. The corrected contention user loads
  the same stable prior-day occurrence through the server-rendered selected
  behavior/day review. Its private session pair binds the exact Behavior, date,
  occurrence, owner, and expected status. The failed run passed zero-write
  integrity, RLS, 6/6 artifact reconciliation, one-user exact cleanup, and zero
  residual rows.
- Standalone run `20260731t040440z-c8b2da9f2887` proved selected-day form
  discovery, then exposed an application-level contention defect. The winning
  status action returned in 56ms, while PostgreSQL error code `40001` made
  PostgREST retry the stale loser for 64.249 seconds. The run appended exactly
  one event and passed integrity, RLS, artifact, and cleanup checks, but its
  semantic gate correctly rejected the delayed ambiguous loser.
- Migration
  `20260731041500_use_nonretryable_occurrence_contention_errors.sql` preserves
  the transactional RPC and changes its two deliberate stale-plan exceptions
  from retryable `40001` to nonretryable `P0001`. A clean local database reset
  applied the complete migration chain and verified both live exception
  markers. The repository translates only those two known structured errors
  to the documented stale-status action result.
- Post-migration diagnostic run `20260731t041025z-4d0b1c472a84` returned the
  stale loser in 59ms, proving the retry storm was removed. It remained
  rejected because the plain structured Supabase error reached the action as a
  generic message. Repository normalization and regression tests now cover
  both known stale messages and hide unknown structured database errors.
- Authoritative focused contention run
  `20260731t041227z-eeff1bbf9832` passed its five-minute stage and independent
  exact-run checker. It completed 726 requests with zero failures, p95 50ms,
  242 status-action submissions with exact semantic readbacks, zero integrity
  violations, RLS success, 6/6 artifact reconciliation, deletion of its one
  synthetic user, and zero residual rows. A fresh uninterrupted full run
  remains required before Ticket 065 can complete.
- Full run `20260731t041910z-685ce0119003` passed 18 stages through corrected
  contention, then rejected the final operator-overlap stage after eight
  seconds. The 60-minute soak completed 43,368 requests with zero failures and
  p95 88ms. Breakpoint 50 passed at p95 160ms, 75 users established a
  zero-failure p95 430ms boundary, timezone preservation verified all 27,319
  captured occurrences, and contention completed 744 requests with zero
  failures and p95 52ms.
- The final-stage failure was deterministic selector invalidation. The prior
  changed-timezone stage used the first five identities and could legitimately
  replace a future Unresolved row. Operator overlap then leased the first ten
  identities, so one fixed Timeline occurrence selector no longer existed.
  Changed-timezone traffic now refreshes and leases the final five identities;
  operator overlap retains the first ten plus its eleventh spare repair
  account. Focused plan, lifecycle, Python lease, lint, and type checks pass.
  The rejected run passed post-failure zero-violation integrity, RLS, 114/114
  artifact reconciliation, cleanup of 100/100 users, and zero residual rows.
- Focused operator run `20260731t071641z-dcfe303bd59e` completed both traffic
  stages with zero request failures, then rejected five due/past reminder
  reactivations. The protected loop began before five Daily users completed
  their startup resolve-and-Clear proof, so it sent those reminders first.
  The first protected operator loop now waits one bounded 20-second readiness
  interval; later loops keep the declared 20-second cadence.
- Replacement operator run `20260731t072654z-27ed797933e3` passed both stages
  and the independent exact-run checker. Operator overlap completed 1,464
  Locust requests with zero failures at 4.87 RPS and p95 79ms. Twenty-nine
  protected requests passed, one spare-account causal repair was proven, all
  16 fake-provider sends were unique, five exercised due/past reminders
  remained cancelled, integrity and RLS passed, all 12/12 artifacts
  reconciled, cleanup deleted 11/11 users, and zero product rows remained.
- Authoritative full run `20260731t073716z-8108c309ba98` passed all 19
  completed stages, the independent exact-run checker, RLS, integrity,
  artifact, and exact-cleanup gates. It served 101,534 Locust requests with
  zero stage failures. The 60-minute soak served 42,794 requests at 11.88 RPS
  and p95 86ms. Ramp 50 was the highest sustainable local plateau at 24.61
  RPS and p95 150ms. Breakpoint 75 established the first zero-failure latency
  boundary at 35.04 RPS and p95 450ms, so breakpoint 100 skipped as declared.
- The accepted full run preserved all 27,312 captured past or resolved
  occurrences through the changed-timezone stage. Contention completed 762
  requests with zero failures and p95 49ms. Operator overlap completed 1,434
  Locust requests with zero failures and p95 79ms. Its 27 protected requests
  proved one spare-account causal repair and accepted 191 unique loopback
  fake-provider sends with zero rejections, duplicates, or Web Push attempts.
- Final integrity found zero violations across 94,375 rows and reconciled
  9,053 appended status events. All 91 exercised due/past reminders remained
  cancelled with zero reactivations. The soak's warmed median app RSS declined
  from 494,731,264 to 481,533,952 bytes, and database connections declined
  from 22 to 21. RLS passed, all 114/114 artifacts reconciled, cleanup deleted
  100/100 synthetic users, and zero product rows remained.
- The first independent check of that unchanged run exposed a checker-only
  cohort-allocation defect. The checker validated the changed-timezone cohort
  against identities 0-4 instead of its declared 95-99 offset. The checker and
  fixture generator now apply each stage's exact identity offset. A full-suite
  regression test covers the disjoint timezone window, and the unchanged run
  passes independent verification. Final repository verification remains
  before Ticket 065 can be marked complete.
- Full mutation run `20260729t213920z-1e245694539d` reached all four ramp
  plateaus with zero request failures, then failed closed on a Locust
  shutdown-accounting mismatch: final HTML and one-use semantic receipts
  counted 154 successful/read-back Behavior restore submissions while the
  asynchronous CSV snapshot retained 152. RLS passed, all 48 completed-stage
  artifacts reconciled without orphans, exact cleanup deleted 100 of 100 users,
  and zero product rows remained. The rejected run is diagnostic only.
- Final Locust in-memory request counts now atomically replace the existing
  stage stats CSV at shutdown. Soak admission also now matches Ticket 065:
  all four ramps and a passing ramp-25 are mandatory, and soak-25 must be
  strictly below an integrity-clean recorded latency boundary or a passing
  higher plateau. Focused verification passed 131 Python tests, 55 mutation
  evidence/lifecycle tests, TypeScript, lint, and 165 agent invariants. A
  fresh uninterrupted full run is still required before completion.
- Full run `20260730t040022z-343af39cb28f` remains rejected: its 100-user
  spike hold crossed the declared failure and p95 gates. The artifact,
  integrity, RLS, and cleanup evidence passed, but a failed stress stage is not
  promotable. The focused replacement spike
  `20260730t052531z-ae1c72853fae` passed the supervised lifecycle and exact-run
  checker, including a clean 10-user recovery after the expected p95-only
  100-user stress result.
- Full run `20260730t060556z-2ac31aca9b05` passed through spike/recovery but
  stopped its soak at 3,447.135 of 3,600 seconds after one export-only session
  returned `401` at JWT rollover. `/api/export/*` now traverses the Supabase
  cookie-refresh proxy without becoming an app-screen redirect route, and
  authenticated/anonymous/invalid-cookie proxy tests preserve the export
  route's JSON `401` contract. Final Locust stats, failures, and exceptions are
  now atomically rewritten from one shutdown snapshot.
- Replacement standalone soak `20260730t083919z-a5462699b1c1` proved the auth
  correction across the full 3,600.646-second traffic stage: 43,204 requests,
  zero failures, 12.0007 RPS, p95 85ms, zero `5xx` or exceptions, exact
  semantic readbacks, zero-violation integrity, RLS pass, 36/36 retained
  artifacts, and cleanup of 100/100 users with zero residual rows. It remains
  rejected because the old RSS gate compared a 65.859 MiB cold idle trough
  before users warmed with one 312.563 MiB hot terminal sample, despite a
  554.375 MiB peak followed by substantial reclamation and database
  connections falling from 22 to 16.
- Mutation run `20260730t104504z-5c16794e5fcd` was interrupted during soak
  before it could write summary or completion evidence. Exact recovery removed
  all 100 run-scoped users and verified zero matching users afterward. The
  partial run remains unusable.
- Authoritative schema `1.1.0` standalone soak
  `20260730t154126z-1f1a904f9ca5` passed all six declared stages and the
  independent exact-run checker. Its 3,601.427-second 25-user soak served
  42,856 requests at 11.9020 RPS with zero failures, p95 110ms, exact semantic
  readbacks, zero-violation integrity, RLS pass, 36/36 retained artifacts, and
  cleanup of 100/100 users with zero residual rows. Database connections fell
  from 22 to 17.
- The accepted soak retained 722 monotonic five-second resource observations.
  Its `[5 minutes, 10 minutes)` median app RSS was 252,502,016 bytes and its
  final-five-minute median was 256,139,264 bytes. Growth was 3,637,248 bytes
  (1.4405%) against the unchanged 134,217,728-byte allowance. Both windows
  retained 60 valid samples, zero invalid samples, and maximum gaps under
  5,003ms. The independent checker recomputed and accepted the bounded-growth
  result. Legacy `1.0.0` runs remain diagnostic and cannot be retroactively
  promoted. A fresh authoritative full suite remains required.
- Full run `20260730t172728z-69ee594dc997` completed 17 stages through the
  changed-timezone profile, then failed closed before contention and operator
  overlap. The changed-timezone profile preserved all 27,150 captured past or
  resolved occurrences and passed 20 exact Settings mutation readbacks. Its
  next integrity checkpoint rejected two fewer reminder rows than the original
  fixture count. The cause was a harness invariant, not an eligible-reminder
  gap: timezone resync may replace a future Unresolved occurrence after its
  reminder became due, while documented planning semantics forbid recreating
  missing due/past deliveries.
- Mutation integrity no longer requires a monotonic total reminder count. It
  still requires every strictly future eligible reminder, rejects duplicate or
  unexpected pending rows, and now preserves the identity of every baseline
  reminder attached to a past or resolved occurrence. Focused lifecycle,
  mutation-suite, and evidence tests pass with 111 checks. The rejected run
  passed RLS, retained the exact 102/102 completed-stage artifacts, deleted all
  100 run users, and left zero product rows. A fresh full suite remains
  required.
- Full retry `20260730t203346z-c8186c148525` remains rejected. Its 100-user
  spike completed 7,682 requests with 41 loopback connection resets, a 0.53%
  failure ratio above the strict less-than-0.5% gate, and p95 5,400ms. RLS
  passed, all 60/60 completed-stage artifacts reconciled, exact cleanup deleted
  100/100 users, and zero product rows remained. The unchanged strict suite is
  being rerun; this result is diagnostic only.
- Full retry `20260730t220333z-43601180a45b` passed smoke, calibration,
  baselines, ramp, spike/recovery, the full 60-minute soak, and breakpoint
  discovery. The soak served 43,038 requests with zero failures at 11.95 RPS
  and p95 100ms. Breakpoint 50 passed at p95 140ms, while 75 users established
  the first zero-failure latency boundary at p95 380ms. Changed-timezone
  traffic also passed, but the following contention stage failed immediately
  because its seed-time current-day occurrence selector had been replaced by
  the preceding timezone resync. RLS passed, exact cleanup deleted 100/100
  users, and zero product rows remained. The rejected run is diagnostic only.
- Contention fixtures now reserve the most recent prior-day Unresolved
  occurrence on the maintainer behavior. Prior-day identities are part of the
  timezone-preservation contract and render under Needs decision, so the
  contention selector remains valid after the required timezone stage. A
  focused fixture test locks the prior-day, owner-behavior, and Unresolved
  properties. A fresh uninterrupted full run remains required.
- Full mutation run `20260729t225646z-3a40ecd7daf3` then passed smoke,
  calibration, both mixed baselines, and the 10/25-user ramp plateaus before a
  harness abort stopped ramp-100 at 232.976 of 240 seconds. The stage retained
  7,161 requests, two GET connection-reset failures, zero `5xx`, and no
  resource breach. Final request accounting matched successful mutation
  submissions, but 16 one-use semantic receipts remained pending because the
  stage ended early. Post-failure integrity and RLS passed; all 48 artifacts
  reconciled without orphans; exact cleanup deleted 100 of 100 users with zero
  residual product rows.
- The second run exposed a false runtime classification: generic loopback HTTP
  resets were treated as database refusals, and inline reentrant shutdown hid
  the triggering request and initiating reason. Generic HTTP transport loss
  now remains under the ordinary request-failure gate; the repeated database
  refusal gate requires explicit database context or an unambiguous
  capacity-refusal message. Guarded abort is now one-shot, sanitized,
  reason-retaining, and deferred until the triggering request reaches Locust
  accounting.
- Ramp run `20260730t014631z-063151d6e33e` completed calibration and all four
  plateaus, but was rejected by an incorrect aggregate due/past reminder gate.
  Its retained final counters were 100 tracked occurrences and deliveries, 102
  Clear events, 100 Unresolved occurrences, 71 cancelled deliveries, and zero
  reactivated deliveries. The old gate incorrectly required all tracked
  deliveries to be cancelled after any Clear and did not retain the unique
  exercised-occurrence count, so the artifact remains rejected.
- The corrected producer and independent checker now retain an exact
  seven-field due/past contract. Authoritative ramp run
  `20260730t023443z-b35dca7c46da` passed calibration and all four declared ramp
  stages, RLS, zero-violation integrity, the exact 30-artifact inventory,
  cleanup of 100 of 100 users with zero residual product rows, and
  `npm run load:mutation:evidence:check`. Its highest sustainable local
  plateau was 50 users at 24.1705 RPS and p95 160ms; 100 users was a
  zero-failure latency boundary at 36.8510 RPS and p95 1,600ms. Final due/past
  evidence was 100 tracked occurrences, 100 tracked deliveries, 71 unique
  exercised occurrences, 102 Clear events, 100 Unresolved occurrences, 71
  cancelled deliveries, and zero reactivations. The result is local-only and
  does not complete Ticket 065 without a passing authoritative full suite.
- `load-tests/scenarios/interaction-map.json` classifies all 85 live
  interactions exactly once; its governance validator is integrated into
  `npm run agents:check` and has mutation fixtures for missing, duplicate, and
  destructive misclassification failures.
- The independent Python tree pins Locust 2.46.2. The Ticket 063 protocol
  supervisor rejects non-loopback Cadence or Supabase targets, creates exactly
  one ordinary synthetic account, keeps the service-role key outside Locust,
  dynamically discovers the current Next.js `$ACTION_*` multipart form fields,
  and verifies cleanup. The Ticket 065 mutation supervisor instead creates the
  exact independent cohort and reserved sessions declared by its selected
  suite.
- Timeline status forms now submit the rendered `expected_status`. A replay
  whose expected state no longer matches the owner-scoped occurrence is
  rejected before the transactional RPC, while direct service callers remain
  compatible.
- The headless protocol proof completed five requests with zero failures:
  public Terms, authenticated Timeline, full JSON export, Completed Server
  Action, and stale replay rejection. Direct persistence verification found
  one explicit-user-mark event and no stale-replay event. Cleanup removed the
  exact Auth user and all owned product rows; an independent aggregate query
  found zero remaining `cadence-load-...@example.invalid` users and profiles.
- An intentionally interrupted first diagnostic run left its owner-only
  recovery file. The corrected supervisor recovered that exact account before
  the passing run, providing evidence for the bounded interrupted-run recovery
  path without a prefix or wildcard deletion.
- Generated reports and session material are ignored under
  `load-tests/.runs/`. No product API, migration, RLS bypass, provider call,
  hosted write, or production load was added.
- The Ticket 064 lifecycle provisions exact run-scoped identities, writes
  product fixtures through ordinary authenticated RLS clients, refreshes
  per-stage sessions outside statistics, leases one unique cookie jar to each
  active virtual user, and removes private session material plus every exact
  run-created user and row in `finally`.
- The five fixture cohorts cover Empty, Typical daily, Review-heavy,
  Export-heavy, and an explicitly tagged Heavy schedule profile. The full
  fixture allocated 10/60/20/10 ordinary accounts plus five reserved heavy
  accounts and passed pre/post integrity over 70,010 rows with zero violations.
- Full local run `20260729t091314z-911e90cdbcf7` passed all 10 declared stages:
  1-user smoke/warm, 5- and 10-user 10-minute baselines, bounded
  10/25/50/100-user ramps, 10-user recovery, and the separate five-user Heavy
  schedule stage. It recorded 14,354 requests, five non-`5xx` transport-status
  `0` failures below the strict 0.5% stage gate, zero unexpected `5xx`,
  cross-account markers, Locust exceptions, or resource breaches, and all 15
  normalized timed request names.
- The one-user warm p95 was 63ms, making the provisional ceiling 126ms. The
  highest stage p95 was 110ms in the tagged Heavy schedule stage. Recovery p95
  was 63ms versus the 64ms pre-ramp baseline, with zero failures in both
  stages.
- Post-load RLS smoke passed. Exact cleanup deleted all 105 users with zero
  residual product rows; an independent Auth query also returned zero matching
  synthetic users. The independent artifact audit found a `0700` report
  directory, 54 `0600` files, zero symlinks, matching digests, no private
  session directory, and no retained path, identity, cookie, token, key, or
  fixture markers.
- The sanitized baseline and local persistent-Node/shared-machine caveats are
  recorded in `docs/PERFORMANCE_SPEED_LOG.md`; the reusable workflow is in
  `docs/LOAD_TESTING_RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, and
  `docs/SUPABASE_WORKFLOW.md`.
- Current official guidance reviewed on 2026-07-31 still recommends Supabase
  load testing on staging and advance support notice for heavy/prolonged hosted
  load, while Vercel load testing remains Enterprise-only and
  approval-coordinated.

Verification:
- `npx vitest run tests/load-test-hosted-preflight.test.ts` passed (one file,
  23 tests).
- `npm run load:hosted:preflight -- --manifest <missing-file>` failed closed
  before network access and omitted the requested private path from its error.
- `npm run load:mutation:full` passed for authoritative run
  `20260731t073716z-8108c309ba98` (19 completed stages, one valid breakpoint
  skip, 101,534 Locust requests, zero stage failures, integrity, RLS, 114/114
  artifacts, cleanup 100/100, and zero residual rows).
- `npm run load:mutation:evidence:check -- --run-id
  20260731t073716z-8108c309ba98` passed after the checker-only identity-offset
  correction.

- A clean `npm run supabase -- db reset` passed after migration
  `20260731041500_use_nonretryable_occurrence_contention_errors.sql`.

Earlier Ticket 063-064 verification:
- `npm run load:manifest:check` passed (1,632 invariants, 85 interactions, 23
  loadable).
- `npm run load:python:test` passed (43 tests).
- `npm run load:protocol:smoke` passed (one user, five requests, zero request

- `git diff --check` passed.

Next action:
- The owner must authorize dedicated synthetic-only Vercel and Supabase staging
  resources, provide Vercel Enterprise and load-approval evidence, name the
  exact staging hostname, and approve the window, sources, limits, USD cost
  ceiling, and monitoring plan. Implement the hosted-specific supervised
  provision/run/cleanup lifecycle only after those gates are concrete. Do not
  run hosted traffic or fall back to production.

## Launch cost guardrails and traffic-surge operations (Ticket 067)

Status: blocked (owner risk policy and provider authorization); local technical
implementation is complete and verified.

Implemented:

- A private, fail-closed cost-policy preflight validates current owner roles,
  ordered USD thresholds, tested primary and backup notification roles,
  provider costs and control gaps, traffic controls, monitoring signals,
  incident levels, and safe-resumption evidence. It rejects secret, payment,
  account, recipient, and raw-provider fields.
- A sanitized provider inventory records current verified facts and every
  unresolved Vercel, Supabase, Sequenzy, domain, and monitoring field.
- Structured downloads now use one atomic Supabase-backed account limit of six
  attempts per 60 seconds across formats and application instances. Denied
  downloads return `429` plus `Retry-After` before export reads.
- Independent server-only breakers can stop email sends, browser-push sends,
  reminder batches, occurrence-sync batches, or structured downloads. They
  preserve Auth, RLS, ordinary Timeline decisions, and pending reminder
  idempotency.
- Protected process routes return `503` plus `Retry-After` when their scoped
  breaker is open. Breaker logs contain only an allow-listed breaker name,
  state, reason code, and blocked count.
- The operations runbook defines separate traffic classes, privacy-safe
  monitoring, candidate Vercel log-only rules, four incident levels, rollback,
  and safe resumption.
- The zero-network technical drill covers seven surge and cost scenarios. It
  generated no provider request or billable traffic. Human proof remains
  pending.

Verification:

- Pass: clean `npm run supabase -- db reset`, including migration
  `20260801051601_add_launch_export_rate_limit.sql`.
- Pass: `npm run smoke:launch-rate-limit:local`; the first six attempts were
  allowed, the seventh was denied, authenticated direct writes were blocked,
  and the transaction rolled back.
- Pass: focused Ticket 067 coverage (10 files, 58 tests).
- Pass: `npm run launch:surge:drill -- --synthetic` (seven scenarios, zero
  network requests, no billable traffic).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`, `npm run interactions:check`,
  `npm run load:manifest:check`, and `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (106 files, 802
  tests), and `npm run build` (Next.js 16.2.7).
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: owner-authorized hosted migration deployment and migration-history
  verification on 2026-08-02 for
  `20260801051601_add_launch_export_rate_limit.sql`.
- Pass: compatible application commit `97ac6247e93eb8029a418266539754baf440bde0`
  reached Vercel production as deployment
  `dpl_4bDCCb3VSq5veZ7GjENt5UgWWecf` with the canonical alias assigned.

Blocking acceptance gates:

- The owner has not approved current provider plans, billing cycles, budgets,
  warning/urgent/emergency USD thresholds, maximum unplanned spend, accepted
  outage, billing roles, incident roles, or tested primary and backup alert
  delivery.
- Vercel notifications, webhook delivery, hard-limit posture, and log-only
  firewall rules remain unconfigured and untested. The team-wide project-pause
  blast radius remains an explicit owner decision.
- Supabase Spend Cap posture remains unverified. Compute and listed add-ons
  remain outside Spend Cap coverage.
- Sequenzy account allowance, account alert or cap, and manual review owner
  remain unverified.
- The non-production human tabletop, false-positive review, OAuth/Cron bypass
  proof, and firewall preview require owner participants and exact targets.
- Provider settings, production breaker environment variables, and firewall
  rules still require exact owner authorization.

The application guardrail and database migration are deployed. No provider
setting changed. No firewall rule was published. No project paused. No plan,
compute size, add-on, budget, or limit changed. No provider message was sent.

Next action:

- The owner supplies the private risk policy and exact provider authorizations.
  Run the private preflight, configure only approved controls, test alert
  delivery and log-only rules, then complete the human drill and sanitized
  acceptance report.

## Occurrence stopwatch capture, reset, and persistence (Ticket 068)

Status: complete.

Scope:

- Add one additive `occurrence_time_sessions` migration with no backfill or
  mutation of existing product rows.
- Add resolver-first start, stop, duration, multiple-session, and reset logic
  with owner-scoped repositories, services, RLS, and generated types.
- Add Track Time, Stop, persisted refresh recovery, combined occurrence time,
  and Reset tracked time to the existing expanded Timeline occurrence row.
- Keep time tracking separate from occurrence status and reminders.
- Update product, data, UI, user-flow, decision, route, resolver, interaction,
  load-manifest, and user-guide contracts during implementation.

Dependencies:

- Ticket 068 is independent of Tickets 066-067. Its implementation and hosted
  migration deployment are complete.

Verification:

- Pass: local `npm run supabase -- db reset`, including
  `20260802000000_add_occurrence_time_sessions.sql` with no timing-session
  backfill.
- Pass: regenerated local Supabase types match
  `lib/db/database.types.ts` apart from a final generated newline.
- Pass: focused Ticket 068 resolver, service, repository, migration, RLS, and
  Timeline UI coverage (22 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`, `npm run interactions:check`,
  `npm run load:manifest:check`, `npm run resolvers:check`,
  `npm run design-system:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and
  `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run test` (111 files, 820 tests) with local loopback permission
  for the existing fake-provider test server.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Hosted migration state:

- Migration `20260802000000_add_occurrence_time_sessions.sql` reached the
  linked hosted Supabase project on 2026-08-02 after owner authorization.
- Authenticated production Timeline QA loaded the new table and exposed Track
  Time on an active current-day occurrence without creating a timing session.

Remaining risk:

- No Ticket 068 schema deployment risk remains.

## Needs decision timing and timer-label refinement

Status: complete.

Scope:

- Expose Track Time for active-behavior occurrences still visible in Needs
  decision while preserving server-side rejection for future, archived, and
  expired resolved occurrences.
- Remove the duplicate static Track time heading from idle and stopped timer
  states. Keep the static, non-underlined label only while a session runs.
- Update resolver-owned eligibility, Timeline UI, design-system previews,
  product contracts, guidance, and regression coverage.

Implementation notes:

- `time-tracking.resolver.ts` now owns start eligibility for current-day and
  visible Needs decision occurrences. Timeline rendering and the timing service
  consume the same rule.
- Idle and stopped timer states render one Track Time action. Running state
  renders a static Track time label above the counter, Stop, and Reset tracked
  time.
- The design-system bench now demonstrates idle, running, and stopped states
  across unresolved, Completed, and Not Completed row tones.

Verification:

- Pass: focused time-tracking resolver, service, Timeline resolver, and Timeline
  UI coverage (4 files, 26 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`, `npm run interactions:check`,
  `npm run load:manifest:check`, `npm run resolvers:check`,
  `npm run design-system:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run test` (111 files, 842 tests), and `npm run build`.
- Pass: desktop 1280px and mobile 390px design-system QA verified one idle
  Track Time action, a non-underlined running label, contrast-aware row tones,
  and no horizontal overflow. The prior Needs decision row rendered Track Time
  on both viewports.

Remaining risk:

- The fixed Needs decision launcher remains clipped inside its contained bench
  trace preview, so browser QA inspected the same `needs_decision` occurrence
  through the OccurrenceRow preview. Direct UI coverage renders the
  `needsDecisionDialog` TimelineGroup variant with Track Time.

## Behavior timing averages and selected-day review (Ticket 069)

Status: complete.

Scope:

- After Ticket 068, add a conditional Average tracked time line to behavior
  outcome metadata using the selected 7, 30, or 90-day range.
- Sum stopped sessions per occurrence, then average only timed occurrence
  totals. Exclude untimed and running-only occurrences.
- Add conditional Tracked time content to Review selected day and reuse Reset
  tracked time inside the existing Review disclosure.
- Add no history disclosure, chart, table, pop-up, modal, route, or empty
  placeholder.

Dependencies:

- Ticket 068 is complete and its hosted migration is deployed.

Verification:

- Pass: focused `tests/analytics.resolver.test.ts`,
  `tests/time-tracking.service.test.ts`, and `tests/behavior-review-ui.test.tsx`
  (26 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`, `npm run interactions:check`,
  `npm run load:manifest:check`, `npm run resolvers:check`,
  `npm run design-system:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run test`, and `npm run build`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Implementation notes:

- Behaviors loads timing sessions in one owner-scoped repository read for the
  selected occurrence range. The analytics resolver sums stopped sessions per
  occurrence, excludes running-only and untimed occurrences, formats values,
  and derives the selected-range average.
- Review selected day conditionally shows recorded time and/or In progress. Its
  existing Review disclosure now reuses the time-tracking reset service and
  refreshes both Behaviors and Timeline without changing Status or Note.

Remaining risk:

- Authenticated production Behaviors QA loaded the timing-aware analytics path
  successfully. No Ticket 069 deployment blocker remains.

## Privacy-gated time-tracking exports (Ticket 070)

Status: complete.

Scope:

- After Tickets 068-069, add an unchecked Include time tracking option to
  Export & Import using `include_time_tracking=1` as the only enabling query
  value.
- Disabled exports must not read or expose timing data and must preserve all
  existing artifact shapes.
- Enabled exports add scoped raw sessions and derived durations to Full JSON,
  JSONL, CSV, BehaviorLog, filenames, selected-range context, and Markdown as
  defined in `docs/TICKETS.md`.
- BehaviorLog timing data remains an optional Cadence export-only file; import
  and restore validate and disclose it but do not replay it in this ticket.

Dependencies:

- Tickets 068 and 069 are complete. Ticket 070 reuses their settled
  persistence, reset, duration, and aggregation semantics.

Verification:

- Pass: focused export resolver, service, page, route, BehaviorLog
  conformance, import, and restore tests (78 tests). Coverage includes exact
  opt-in parsing, disabled repository no-call, deterministic session ordering,
  range and archived filtering, CSV escaping, optional-file hashing, and
  export-only import/restore behavior.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`, `npm run interactions:check`,
  `npm run load:manifest:check`, `npm run resolvers:check`,
  `npm run design-system:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run test` (111 files, 838 tests), `npm run build`, and
  `git diff --check`.
- Pass: authenticated production Export QA confirmed the option is unchecked by
  default, default download links omit timing, and the exact opt-in URL adds
  `include_time_tracking=1` to all four download links plus the timing count.
- Pass: Vercel deployment `dpl_4bDCCb3VSq5veZ7GjENt5UgWWecf` is `READY` for
  commit `97ac6247e93eb8029a418266539754baf440bde0`, owns the canonical alias,
  and showed no runtime error logs or `5xx` responses in the post-deploy scan.

Implementation notes:

- Default exports never query `occurrence_time_sessions`. The exact
  `include_time_tracking=1` option scopes the owner read to occurrences already
  selected by range and archived-behavior filtering.
- Enabled Full JSON, JSONL, CSV, BehaviorLog, filenames, selected-range
  summary, and Markdown include timing with stopped-only duration aggregates.
  BehaviorLog uses an optional hashed Cadence extension file.

Remaining limitation:

- Time-session history remains export-only. Import and restore validate the
  optional Cadence file and hash but do not replay timing sessions.
- Authenticated Chrome QA reproduced a React hydration warning on both the
  prior and current deployments. It did not block Timeline, Behaviors, Export,
  or the option flow; its root cause remains unverified.

## Mobile Timeline refresh and completion-feedback regressions (Ticket 071)

Status: complete.

Implemented:

- Wrapped the current-day and future Timeline feed in a mobile-only gesture
  controller. It starts only at the document top, ignores interactive controls,
  locks to downward movement, uses a 72px threshold, prevents native overscroll
  after the lock, and allows one route refresh while a refresh is in flight.
- Added restrained `Pull to refresh`, `Release to refresh`, and
  `Refreshing timeline` live feedback. The gesture adds no mutation, route,
  service worker, offline cache, or permanent toolbar.
- Added the duplicate-chime harness before the playback fix. The corrected
  pre-fix harness failed because one guarded mobile activation created two
  `HTMLAudioElement.play()` paths: the muted gesture primer and the confirmed
  post-success playback. One status submission still occurred.
- Removed the separate media-element primer. Gesture preparation now resumes
  and primes Web Audio only. The confirmed success path owns the single media
  playback attempt and keeps the existing Web Audio and synth fallbacks.
- Anchored resolved labels and unresolved action controls to the 48px summary
  line. Expanded details no longer enlarge the alignment row and push the
  Completed or Not Completed label downward.
- Added the supplied evidence at
  `docs/qa/ticket-071/timeline-collapsed.png` and
  `docs/qa/ticket-071/timeline-expanded-status-misalignment.png`.
- Updated product specs, user flows, route ownership, user guidance,
  interaction traceability, load classification, the design-system contract,
  Timeline fixtures, and design-system inventories.

Verification:

- The focused regression set passed 31 tests across pull gestures, Timeline
  wiring, expanded-row alignment, status submission, and completion feedback.
- Connected Chromium touch emulation at 390px showed the below-threshold and
  ready feedback states. Releasing after 92px showed `Refreshing timeline` and
  issued one Timeline React Server Component request.
- The Chromium status fixture recorded one `HTMLMediaElement.play()` attempt
  and one `cadence:completion-chime-played media` event for one Completed click.
- Expanded Completed rows measured zero status/title center drift at 390px and
  desktop. The 320px measurement differed by 0.004px from subpixel rounding.
- `npm run agents:check` passed 178 invariants.
- `npm run interactions:check` passed 4,498 invariants across 88 interactions
  and 37 interaction sources.
- `npm run load:manifest:check` passed 1,665 invariants across 88 interactions
  and 23 loadable interactions.
- `npm run resolvers:check`, `npm run design-system:check`, `npm run lint`,
  `npm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- `npm run test` passed 856 tests across 114 files. The first sandboxed run
  failed only because the fake Sequenzy tests could not bind a loopback port;
  the authorized rerun passed.
- `npm run build` passed.

Remaining limitations:

- Physical audibility on the reported phone is not verified. The automated
  evidence proves the removed duplicate media playback attempt and the
  exact-once playback-start event.
- Mobile WebKit was unavailable. The connected browser supplied Chromium only.
- The authenticated `/timeline` route redirected to Login because the guarded
  local test-login environment was not enabled. Browser QA used the
  fixture-backed design-system route that renders the production components and
  the real server-action success path without changing product data.

## Profile email integrity and reminder recipient trust (Ticket 079)

Status: complete locally.

Implemented:

- Added migration
  `20260825061411_protect_profile_email_and_reminder_delivery_state.sql`.
- Removed authenticated profile insert, table-wide update, and delete grants.
  Authenticated clients retain profile select and may update only `timezone`.
- Added an Auth email-update trigger that synchronizes `profiles.email` from
  `auth.users.email`, matching the existing account-creation source of truth.
- Added a reminder-delivery before-update guard. Non-`service_role` callers
  cannot move `sent` or `failed` deliveries to `pending`, or clear a non-null
  `processing_started_at` claim.
- Preserved user-scoped pending planning, cancellation, and unclaimed
  cancelled-delivery reactivation. The server-only processor retains the
  `service_role` maintenance exception.
- Extended the authenticated RLS smoke with profile timezone and protected
  identity-field writes, Auth email propagation, reminder planning,
  cancellation, reactivation, terminal recycling, and claim-clearing proof.
- Updated the data and notification contracts. Added a static migration
  permission and trigger regression test.
- Database types were not regenerated. The migration changes privileges and
  trigger behavior only; it adds no Data API row or callable RPC type shape.

Verification:

- Pass: focused Ticket 079 coverage with
  `npm run test -- tests/profile-email-reminder-integrity-migration.test.ts tests/supabase-function-permissions-migration.test.ts tests/rls-smoke-script.test.ts tests/reminder.service.test.ts tests/occurrence.service.test.ts tests/settings.service.test.ts`
  (6 files, 68 tests).
- Pass: clean `npm run supabase -- db reset` through the Ticket 079 migration.
- Pass: `npm run smoke:rls:local` created and cleaned three temporary users and
  verified 51 ownership and integrity checks through ordinary authenticated
  clients. The local stack required restarting only its stopped PostgREST and
  API gateway containers after reset.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (178 invariants),
  `npm run interactions:check` (4,484 invariants), and
  `npm run resolvers:check` (169 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (123 files passed,
  1 skipped; 953 tests passed, 1 skipped), and `npm run build`.
- The first sandboxed full-test run failed only because the existing fake
  Sequenzy tests could not bind `127.0.0.1`. The approved loopback-capable
  rerun passed without source changes.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.

Rollout status and remaining risk:

- No hosted migration, provider operation, deployment, email send, commit, or
  push occurred. Hosted migration deployment remains unauthorized.
- Production remains vulnerable until the owner authorizes the migration-first
  hosted rollout and the same authenticated RLS smoke passes against that
  target.

## Reminder pipeline claim recovery and channel isolation (Ticket 080)

Status: complete locally.

Implemented:

- Made pending reminder claims strictly older than 15 minutes due and
  reclaimable. Due selection and conditional claim updates share the same
  predicate, so concurrent workers cannot both win one abandoned claim.
- Classified successful abandoned-claim recovery as a retry and added a
  privacy-safe monitoring event containing only the channel and retry flag.
- Added 10-second `AbortSignal.timeout` bounds at email, browser-push, and
  reminder-service provider boundaries. Web Push also uses the matching SDK
  socket timeout. Timeouts follow the existing delivery-failure path.
- Made sent updates conditional on `status = 'pending'` and return whether a
  row changed. A zero-row result leaves a mid-flight cancellation intact,
  emits privacy-safe monitoring, and increments cancelled instead of sent.
- Constructed the Sequenzy sender only after a due-email query returns rows.
  Missing email configuration now fails claimed due emails while browser push
  continues. Email and browser-push channel processing starts concurrently.
- Added focused repository, orchestration, provider-timeout, cancellation,
  concurrent-reclaim, monitoring, and channel-isolation coverage. Updated the
  notification contract. No schema or generated database type changed.

Verification:

- Pass: focused Ticket 080 coverage with
  `npm run test -- tests/reminder-deliveries.repo.test.ts tests/reminder.service.test.ts tests/sequenzy.service.test.ts tests/web-push-subject.test.ts`
  (4 files, 40 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (178 invariants),
  `npm run interactions:check` (4,484 invariants), and
  `npm run resolvers:check` (169 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (123 files passed,
  1 skipped; 961 tests passed, 1 skipped), `npm run build`, and
  `git diff --check`.
- The first sandboxed full-test run failed only because the existing fake
  Sequenzy tests could not bind `127.0.0.1`. The approved loopback-capable
  rerun passed without source changes.

Rollout status and remaining risk:

- No schema change, database reset, hosted mutation, provider operation,
  deployment, notification send, commit, or push occurred.
- Production retains the old reminder processor until the owner authorizes an
  application deployment. The local tests use deterministic repository and
  provider fakes; hosted reminder processing remains unverified in this task.

## Complete reads for export and restore (Ticket 081)

Status: complete locally.

Implemented:

- Added one shared PostgREST range-read helper with fixed 1,000-row pages,
  exact-page continuation, deterministic caller ordering, duplicate and
  non-advancing-page rejection, page-error propagation, and a fail-loud
  100,000-row absolute ceiling.
- Routed complete user-scoped reads for Behaviors, Behavior schedules, schedule
  slots, Occurrences, Occurrence status events, imported Notes, BehaviorLog
  record mappings, and imported interventions through the helper. Schedule
  rows are reassembled instead of relying on capped embedded arrays.
  Status-event reads normalize and batch Occurrence IDs before restoring global
  `recorded_at`, `id` order.
- Reused the helper for Ticket 094 arbitrary-ID and retention-presence
  time-session response ranges without changing its owner-scoped RPC batching,
  deduplication, or global ordering.
- Preserved Ticket 094 historical time-session and Ticket 095-097 definition
  and configuration fixed-high-water keyset semantics. Added the same absolute
  ceiling plus duplicate or non-advancing cursor rejection. Definition and
  configuration history reads now also fail when a captured high-water row is
  not reached before pagination returns an empty page.
- Kept the main Export-page RPC unchanged because it returns one JSON row.
  Manifest and summary counts continue to derive from fully materialized arrays.
- Added focused helper, repository, restore-graph materialization, and Export
  service coverage. A 1,001-definition-event and 1,001-time-session export now
  proves the true BehaviorLog manifest counts.
- Reused Ticket 094's 2026-08-12 local and hosted `max_rows = 1000` evidence.
  No hosted inspection or mutation occurred.

Verification:

- Pass: focused Ticket 081 coverage with
  `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-ui.test.tsx tests/complete-reads.repo.test.ts tests/paginated-read.test.ts tests/export.service.test.ts tests/time-sessions.repo.test.ts tests/behavior-definition-events.repo.test.ts tests/behavior-configuration-events.repo.test.ts`
  (7 files, 66 tests).
- Pass: focused import-write fake-repository compatibility coverage with
  `npm run test -- tests/behaviorlog-import-write.service.test.ts tests/behaviorlog-import-intervention-history.test.ts`
  (2 files, 24 tests).
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (178 invariants),
  `npm run interactions:check` (4,484 invariants), and
  `npm run resolvers:check` (169 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (125 files passed,
  1 skipped; 978 tests passed, 1 skipped), `npm run build`, and
  `git diff --check`.
- The first sandboxed full-test run also exposed missing `.range()` support in
  two in-memory Supabase fakes. Those fakes now model range slicing. The final
  loopback-capable full run passed.
- No migration or schema change was introduced, so the local Supabase database
  reset was not required for Ticket 081.

Rollout status and remaining risk:

- No hosted mutation, provider operation, deployment, email send, commit, or
  push occurred.
- Reads above 100,000 rows now stop with a clear error by contract. A future
  larger-account strategy must change that explicit ceiling before export or
  restore can proceed.

## Settings write atomicity and account-deletion ordering (Ticket 083)

Status: complete locally.

Implemented:

- Reordered account deletion to validate both gates, construct and verify the
  server-only client with `admin.getUserById`, hard-delete the Auth user, then
  attempt global sign-out. Client construction, verification, thrown provider
  failures, and returned delete errors now produce specific recoverable
  messages before any session mutation.
- Kept a post-delete sign-out error on the success path. Auth hard deletion has
  already removed Auth session rows and refresh capability, so the application
  redirects to Login instead of presenting an impossible deletion retry.
- Added explicit expiration for every current `sb-*-auth-token*` cookie after
  deletion. This prevents an issued JWT left by a failed SDK sign-out from
  redirecting the success destination back into the protected app.
- Reused the Ticket 095-097 owner-scoped timezone function. It updates the
  profile, every active Behavior, configuration history, and the stale sync
  ledger inside one transaction. Occurrence sync remains outside and
  rerunnable.
- Added migration
  `20260825075255_fix_settings_timezone_conflict_errors.sql`. It preserves the
  complete history-aware function and changes its stale profile, active-set,
  and Behavior precondition errors from retryable `40001` to non-retryable
  `P0001`.
- Extended the authenticated local RLS smoke. A deliberately stale Behavior
  timestamp fails only after the profile update statement executes, then
  follow-up reads prove transaction rollback. A valid retry proves one profile
  update, one Behavior update, one configuration event, and exactly one
  sync-state version increment. A stale-profile retry performs no write.
- Updated `INT-SETTINGS-003` and `INT-SETTINGS-009`, account/timezone source
  docs, the user guide, and the Supabase workflow to match observed ordering,
  rollback, retry, and access-token semantics.

Verification:

- Pass: focused Ticket 083 coverage with
  `npm run test -- tests/account-deletion.service.test.ts tests/settings.service.test.ts tests/settings-timezone-atomicity-migration.test.ts tests/behavior-configuration-events-migration.test.ts tests/rls-smoke-script.test.ts tests/ux-ticket-049-052-ui.test.tsx`
  (6 files, 44 tests).
- Pass: explicit returned/throwing sign-out cleanup and auth-cookie expiration
  coverage with
  `npm run test -- tests/account-deletion.service.test.ts tests/supabase-server-cookies.test.ts`
  (2 files, 10 tests).
- Pass: clean `npm run supabase -- db reset` through the Ticket 083 migration.
- Pass: `npm run smoke:rls:local` created and cleaned three temporary users and
  verified 56 ownership and transaction checks.
- Pass: generated local database types match `lib/db/database.types.ts` except
  for one trailing blank line. The function signature did not change.
- Pass: local Supabase security advisors at warning level and performance
  advisors at error level reported no issues.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (178 invariants),
  `npm run interactions:check` (4,506 invariants), and
  `npm run resolvers:check` (169 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (128 files passed,
  1 skipped; 1,000 tests passed, 1 skipped), `npm run build`, and
  `git diff --check`.
- The final sandboxed build rerun failed only because the configured Google
  font fetch lacked network access. The approved network-capable rerun passed
  without source changes.
- Two pre-migration smoke attempts returned gateway timeout. Local Postgres
  logs showed the intended stale-Behavior exception repeating under SQLSTATE
  `40001`. Both attempts ran exact temporary-user cleanup. The non-retryable
  migration removed the retry storm, and the final smoke passed in 4.8 seconds.

Rollout status and remaining risk:

- No hosted migration, provider mutation, deployment, notification send,
  commit, or push occurred. Hosted migration and application deployment remain
  unauthorized.
- Supabase Auth hard deletion removes Auth session rows and refresh capability.
  Already-issued stateless access-token JWTs can remain valid until `exp`, and
  global sign-out cannot retroactively revoke them. The configured JWT lifetime
  bounds this residual window.

## Governance checks, environment contract, and database operations (Ticket 093)

Status: complete locally.

Implemented:

- Upgraded the interaction registry to schema `1.2.0`. Optional
  `effect_checks` bind a recorded effect to a named handler and stable evidence
  inside that handler. The Note-write contract is the first fully mechanical
  entry. A deliberately altered delete handler remains a negative fixture.
- Replaced headline invariant totals with factual checker scope. The
  interaction checker reports mechanically checked entries separately from
  entries requiring human side-effect review. The current result is 1 checked
  entry and 87 human-review entries, with every unchecked effect listed.
- Extended resolver caller checks to reject direct `.rpc(` and `.upsert(` use
  under `app` and `components`. Both bypasses have negative fixtures.
- Replaced the fixed environment-variable allowlist with a source-derived scan
  across app, component, library, marketing, and script source. `.env.example`
  now documents every discovered variable, including routing fallbacks,
  performance flags, design-system tooling, and supervised load-test values.
  The missing-variable behavior has a negative fixture.
- Added CLI-created migration
  `20260825080815_add_occurrence_sync_batch_order_index.sql`. Its composite
  index matches the daily sync batch order exactly.
- Added a post-`20260825075255` migration governance boundary. New migrations
  with a backfill or `SET NOT NULL` require explicit `BEGIN` and `COMMIT`.
  Historical applied migrations remain unchanged. An unsafe backfill is a
  negative fixture.
- Updated the Vercel workflow with both scheduled jobs. Updated
  `INT-SETTINGS-004` so denied permission still exposes Refresh this device.
- Added a 10-creation per-process test-login quota. Failed creation or a
  successfully cleaned failed sign-in releases its reservation. Operators now
  clean temporary users after each QA run and daily while test login is
  enabled.

Verification:

- Pass: focused Ticket 093 coverage with
  `npm run test -- tests/test-login.test.ts tests/test-login-cleanup-script.test.ts tests/occurrence-sync-batch-index-migration.test.ts`
  (3 files, 13 tests).
- Pass: checker positive and negative fixtures through `npm run agents:check`,
  `npm run interactions:check`, and `npm run resolvers:check`.
- Pass: clean `npm run supabase -- db reset` through the Ticket 093 migration.
- Pass: local `EXPLAIN` with sequential scans disabled selected an index-only
  scan through `occurrence_sync_state_batch_order_idx` for the exact repository
  ordering and `LIMIT 25`.
- Pass: local Supabase advisors for the affected `public` schema reported no
  errors. The all-schema advisor command still reports the pre-existing
  Ticket 060 temporary-table helper error in `cadence_private`; Ticket 093 did
  not change that function.
- Pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (129 files passed,
  1 skipped; 1,003 tests passed, 1 skipped), `npm run build`, and
  `git diff --check`.
- The first sandboxed build failed only because `next/font` could not fetch IBM
  Plex Sans. The approved network-capable rerun passed without source changes.

Rollout status and remaining risk:

- No hosted migration, provider mutation, deployment, notification send,
  commit, push, or GitHub mutation occurred. Hosted migration and application
  deployment remain unauthorized.
- The 87 explicitly listed human-review interaction entries remain outside
  mechanical side-effect verification. The checker does not count them as
  mechanically checked.

## Owner-scoped time-session query transport (Ticket 094)

Status: complete.

Implemented:

- Added authenticated-only, owner-scoped arbitrary-ID and historical
  time-session RPCs. Both are `STABLE`, `SECURITY INVOKER`, use an empty
  `search_path`, retain RLS, and return six minimal columns.
- Added the EXPLAIN-backed `(user_id, started_at, id)` time-session index.
- Replaced the oversized direct table read with sequential 2,000-ID batches,
  1,000-row response continuation, deduplication, stable global ordering, and
  non-advancing-page rejection.
- Added 1,000-row keyset history paging with one fixed high-water instant and
  non-advancing or regressing cursor rejection.
- Routed Analytics and optional time-tracking Export reads through joined
  local-date history. Timeline and single-Occurrence reads remain on the
  arbitrary-ID path.
- Regenerated database types and added migration, repository, Analytics,
  Timeline, Export, and RLS smoke coverage.
- Added `npm run smoke:rls:local`. It reads CLI-reported local credentials,
  requires a loopback URL, and cannot inherit a hosted URL from `.env.local`.

Verification:

- Pass: clean `npm run supabase -- db reset` through migration
  `20260812172823_add_time_session_query_rpcs.sql`.
- Pass: regenerated local database types match `lib/db/database.types.ts`
  apart from a trailing blank line.
- Pass: loopback `npm run smoke:rls:local` created and cleaned two temporary
  users and verified 23 table, RPC ownership, archive, high-water, cursor,
  validation, and anonymous-denial checks.
- Pass: a local Data API spike returned 1,001 unique rows through `[1000, 1]`
  pages for both RPCs.
- Pass: local Supabase security advisors at warning level and performance
  advisors at error level reported no issues.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check` (178 invariants),
  `npm run interactions:check` (4,484 invariants), and
  `npm run resolvers:check` (169 invariants).
- Pass: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (117 files, 882
  tests), `npm run build`, and `git diff --check`. The first sandboxed full-test
  run failed only because fake-provider tests could not bind loopback; the
  authorized rerun passed.

Rollout status:

- The owner authorized hosted migration and application deployment on
  2026-08-12. Preflight found only Ticket 094 pending in hosted migration
  history. `npm run supabase -- db push --linked --yes` applied migration
  `20260812172823_add_time_session_query_rpcs.sql`. A final dry run reported the
  hosted database up to date.
- Hosted inspection confirmed both exact signatures, `STABLE` invoker mode,
  empty search paths, the new index, and execute permission for
  `authenticated` only. Hosted migration history matches git through
  `20260812172823`.
- Hosted `npm run smoke:rls` passed all 23 ownership, archive, high-water,
  cursor, validation, and anonymous-denial checks through ordinary clients.
  Both hosted smoke runs cleaned their two temporary users.
- A disposable 1,001-session hosted fixture confirmed `max_rows = 1000`. The
  unpaged arbitrary-ID RPC returned 1,000 rows. Arbitrary-ID response ranges
  and history keyset pages both returned `[1000, 1]` without gaps or
  duplicates. Cleanup removed the temporary user, and an aggregate auth query
  confirmed zero matching users remained.
- Commit `a0fd750e3a936067c2142de350f43f9cfca559cb` reached production through
  Vercel deployment `dpl_H2S7N2td7K62iAQ35S7ABQFXrs1q`. The deployment is
  `READY` and serves the canonical `cadence-blush-three.vercel.app` alias.
- Authenticated production QA passed Behaviors ranges 7, 30, and 90. The
  90-day range rendered 666 occurrences and timing analytics without the prior
  `Bad Request`. Timeline rendered its Track Time control. Export rendered six
  timing sessions with `include_time_tracking=1` across every download link.
- Vercel reported no post-deployment runtime error clusters, 5xx responses, or
  recurrence of digest `2953342693@E394`. Chrome still reported the pre-existing
  React hydration warning documented under Ticket 070; it did not block any
  Ticket 094 route.
- One verification attempt inherited the hosted `.env.local` target before the
  loopback-only command existed. It created two temporary smoke users, stopped
  at the missing RPC, and ran cleanup. A read-only follow-up confirmed zero
  `cadence-rls-smoke-*` users remained. No hosted schema changed.

## Public repository security release gate (Ticket 098)

Status: complete. The audited release decision is PASS.

Ticket 098 cleared the public-repository security release gate. The audited
executable commit is `6c07538f13df1a358bd8902383b9f109e4da0509` with parent
`57171c3f17b32b83acd60b31a27938c856675731`. The commit containing this PASS
record changes only `STATUS.md` and `docs/PUBLIC_REPOSITORY_RELEASE.md` from
that executable commit. Its exact hash belongs in the external release
handoff, which avoids a self-referential commit claim.

Verification complete:

- Pass: private GitHub `main` contains the authorized history rewrite and the
  executable commit. The repository remains private and unarchived. It has one
  branch, no tags, no issues, no pull requests, no releases, and no Actions
  runs. Wiki, Discussions, and Pages remain disabled.
- Pass: Gitleaks 8.30.1 and the Cadence public-source checker found no secret,
  private-recipient, history-metadata, or client-environment finding. The fresh
  executable clone contains 140 commits and all required policy files.
- Pass: clean dependency installation reproduced Next 16.3.3, Astro 7.2.6,
  esbuild 0.28.2, PostCSS 8.5.26, sharp 0.35.3, and SVGO 4.1.0 without changing
  either manifest or the root lockfile. Full and production-only npm audits
  returned zero findings.
- Pass: all repository checks, lint, typecheck, 1,008 tests with one skipped
  test, the exact Next 16.3.3 Turbopack build, the Astro build, and the Astro
  check passed. Six public canaries had intended placements only. Ten
  server-only canaries were absent. Final placement counts were 20 Next and 23
  marketing artifact files.
- Pass: a clean local Supabase reset applied all 33 migrations through
  `20260825080815_add_occurrence_sync_batch_order_index.sql`. The catalog audit
  covered 18 RLS-enabled public tables and 12 authenticated functions. Local
  RLS smoke passed 92 ownership checks and cleaned three temporary users.
- Pass: hosted migration and catalog reads match local state. The linked
  project has no pending migration. Hosted RLS smoke evidence remains valid
  because no schema or RLS source changed. The bounded final window forbade
  deleting hosted data, so the gate reused that already-passed 92-check smoke
  instead of creating new fixtures.
- Pass: production web deployment `dpl_3KGt9dNUy2bg1UxtMdLWDakqDBSZ` is READY
  at the executable commit. Vercel ran the default Next Turbopack build. All
  audited public and authenticated-route boundaries responded as expected.
- Pass: production marketing deployment `dpl_7gLBemWhZ9WuaUujD2npwu62JUGd`
  is READY at the executable commit. It consumed the committed root workspace,
  lockfile, and overrides, resolved esbuild 0.28.2, and completed the Astro
  build. All 19 audited public endpoints returned HTTP 200.
- Pass: the inline Astro PostCSS boundary keeps marketing independent from the
  web application's Tailwind plugin while preserving one root lockfile and one
  override policy. The canonical aliases and domains remain unchanged.
- Pass: the recovery directory remains mode 700 at
  `/private/tmp/cadence-ticket098-history-rewrite-XTnslg`. Its mode-600 bundle
  and backups remain intact. Detached worktrees and old local objects were not
  pruned.

Release decision: PASS. Ticket 100 may begin only after separate explicit
authorization. This pass does not authorize public visibility, repository
settings changes, or any provider send.

## Open-source license and disclosure contract (Ticket 099)

Status: complete locally. Safe local policy implementation, monitor assignment,
and recipient-side route verification are complete.

Prepared:

- Added `docs/OPEN_SOURCE_DECISION_PACKET.md` as a public-safe final decision
  record. Root `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, and `README.md` remain the operative
  public terms.
- Inventoried every direct Node and Python dependency, declared license,
  bundled font, imported icon library, tracked image and audio group, generated
  sample bundle, BehaviorLog material, and existing third-party provenance
  signal.
- Distinguished the hosted Terms, Privacy, and Trust pages from source,
  trademark, asset, sample-content, and user-data rights.
- Recorded the owner's MIT selection, dedicated-security-email primary route,
  post-publication GitHub private-reporting secondary route, split copyright
  scope, included-group rights confirmation, binary-asset exclusions, and
  reserved Cadence marks.
- Recorded the repository owner as the security inbox monitor. The owner
  authorized exactly one harmless synthetic route-test email to the approved
  address.
- Kept copyright licensing separate from permission to use Cadence names or
  logos as trademarks. No affirmative trademark-use grant is approved.
- Added the standard root MIT `LICENSE` with
  `Copyright (c) 2026 Identity Scaffolding LLC`.
- Added root `SECURITY.md` with `security@identityscaffolding.com` as the
  primary private route, post-publication GitHub private reporting as the
  secondary route, current-production/latest-source support, requested report
  details, coordinated disclosure, and safe research boundaries.
- Fetched the exact MIT license from the pinned BehaviorLog validator commit
  and preserved it in the narrowly scoped `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- Updated `README.md`, Operations, Decisions, public architecture, and the
  release record with the split MIT scope, named binary-asset exclusions,
  reserved marks, self-hosting secret responsibilities, and hosted-service and
  user-data boundaries.
- Reviewed the hosted Terms, Privacy, and Trust copy. It remains a separate
  service contract and needs no content change for the selected email and
  GitHub reporting routes.

Operational follow-up:

- The test message landed in the junk folder. Monitor junk and quarantine
  folders or maintain appropriate allowlisting so filtered private reports
  receive review.

Later follow-up:

- Test GitHub private vulnerability reporting separately after Ticket 100
  enables it.

Verification:

- Pass: `npm run agents:check`.
- Pass: `npm run interactions:check` (1 mechanically checked entry; 87 entries
  explicitly require human side-effect review).
- Pass: `npm run resolvers:check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: permission-enabled `npm run test` (130 files passed, 1 skipped; 1,008
  tests passed, 1 skipped). The first sandboxed run failed only because the
  existing fake Sequenzy server could not bind loopback.
- Pass: `npm run build`.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:build` built five static pages after generating the
  sanitized example bundle. Astro reported zero errors, warnings, or hints.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check`; Astro reported zero diagnostics and the
  agent-readability check passed.
- Pass: `npm run public-source:check` reviewed 571 tracked and unignored text
  files plus all-ref patch history. It found zero worktree or history
  credential-pattern findings and zero client environment violations.
- Pass: focused policy inspection found the approved holder and email in the
  root files and no placeholder in `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `README.md`, or
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- Pass: `git diff --check`.
- Pass: the root execution context sent exactly one authorized synthetic
  private-route test. The sender accepted and retained the message with sent
  status. Recipient-side inspection confirmed receipt at the approved mailbox;
  the message landed in the junk folder. No screenshot, sender address,
  provider identifier, message header, message content, vulnerability detail,
  credential, user data, or behavioral content was recorded.

Ticket 098 now passes. Ticket 100 remains `not_started` and still requires
separate explicit authorization. The one authorized synthetic route-test
email was Ticket 099's only recipient mutation.
Ticket 099 made no GitHub, deployment, publication, commit, or push mutation.
Ticket 098 later performed the separately authorized private `main` rewrite.

## Public repository publication and GitHub controls (Ticket 100)

Status: in progress. Read-only inventory and safe local staging started on
2026-08-25. The repository remains private. No GitHub setting, branch, commit,
push, pull request, deployment, domain, environment, provider, or visibility
state changed.

Prepared locally:

- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with pull-request-only, read-only `CI /
  verify` coverage for the documented repository, application, and marketing
  checks under Node.js 24.
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` with weekly npm-workspace and GitHub Actions
  updates.
- Updated `README.md` with the canonical repository and complete
  unauthenticated verification command set.
- Updated Operations, Vercel, and public-release guidance with the ordered
  approval gates, production checks, and repository-owner rollback role.
- Confirmed that marketing already points `View on GitHub` to the canonical
  repository, so no marketing source change is needed.

Current read-only GitHub findings:

- Private, unarchived repository with `main` as its default and only branch at
  `a640740798514ac6b6bbe054e0240f400160a03d`; no tag, issue, pull request,
  release, Actions run, workflow, classic protection, ruleset, deploy key,
  webhook, or Pages site.
- Wiki and Discussions are disabled. Repository Actions and Dependabot secret
  inventories are empty. The unrestricted `Preview` and `Production`
  environments have no Actions secret or variable.
- Actions allows all actions without mandatory SHA pinning. The default
  workflow token is read-only. Fork pull-request workflows, Actions pull
  request approval, and cross-repository workflow sharing are disabled.
  Artifact and log retention is 90 days.
- The dependency graph, Dependabot alerts and security updates, private
  vulnerability reporting, secret scanning, push protection, and code scanning
  are disabled or unavailable before publication. No initial alert scan exists
  to triage yet.
- Six installed repository GitHub Apps were reviewed. The public release
  record omits their identities and permissions. The sanitized collaborator
  inventory is complete: one collaborator has administrator access. No
  identity is recorded.

Verification:

- Pass: permission-enabled `npm ci`; 741 packages installed and npm found zero
  vulnerabilities.
- Pass: `npm run agents:check`, `npm run interactions:check`,
  `npm run resolvers:check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck`.
- Pass: permission-enabled `npm run test`; 130 files and 1,008 tests passed,
  with one environment-gated file and test skipped. The first sandboxed run
  failed only because five fake-provider tests could not bind loopback.
- Pass: `npm run marketing:check` and `npm run marketing:build`; Astro reported
  zero diagnostics and built five pages.
- Pass: `npm run build -- --webpack` as local compile proof; Next compiled,
  typechecked, and generated all routes.
- Pass: `npm run public-source:check` reviewed 573 tracked and unignored text
  files with zero source, history, or client-environment finding.
- Pass: both new GitHub configuration files parse as YAML, and
  `git diff --check` passes.
- Environment-blocked: exact `npm run build` cannot create Turbopack's local
  worker port in this child execution context. Three attempts, including the
  escalation path, stopped at `EPERM` before source compilation. The root
  execution context reproduced the same managed-environment limitation.
  Pull-request CI must pass the exact command before protection or publication.

The owner opened one bounded Ticket 100 completion window after this local
staging. Continue in the documented dependency order. Do not protect `main`,
merge, or publish until the exact pull-request CI workflow passes from the
non-default branch.

## Handoff notes

- For the next coding agent: production browser push subscription is now
  verified in Chrome as permission granted with an active FCM subscription, and
  browser-push production delivery has been verified with a safe temporary due
  reminder. Chrome will not show the native notification permission prompt again
  for an already granted or denied origin unless the site permission is reset.
  Production cron execution has been verified through Vercel runtime logs.
- Ticket 029 completed the first public web hardening baseline. Ticket 030 completed
  first-run onboarding, privacy-safe structured runtime monitoring, and the
  `npm run smoke:rls` many-user RLS smoke command. Re-run the smoke command
  before broad public launch and after material RLS/schema changes.
- Ticket 025 is now split into 025A restore preview and 025B restore apply/UI.
  Implement 025A first, verify it fully, then implement 025B. Ticket 025B is
  intentionally more destructive than the current import/create/merge paths.
- Do not start deferred offline/PWA, workspace restructuring, desktop/mobile, billing, or AI work unless the relevant docs and tickets move that work into active scope.
- Run `npm run agents:check` and `npm run resolvers:check` before standard lint/typecheck/test/build verification.
- Run `npm run design-system:check` after changing reusable UI, the bench route, or design-system manifest/usage/config files.
- Use `docs/SUPABASE_WORKFLOW.md` for Supabase CLI local/hosted management and `docs/SEQUENZY_WORKFLOW.md` for Sequenzy CLI/provider operations.
- Keep v1 small. Do not implement deferred PWA/offline behavior from `docs/FUTURE_UPDATES.md` unless the active docs are updated first.
- Preserve the resolver-first architecture: core logic belongs in `lib/resolvers`, database access in `lib/db`, orchestration in `lib/services`, and UI/API routes should not duplicate resolver logic.
